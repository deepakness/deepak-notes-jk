I"¿<p>Whom should you be grateful to? ğŸ™‹â€â™‚ï¸</p>

<p>Answer: Everybody. ğŸ±â€ğŸ</p>

<p>Almost everybody you met has taught you something, even if you didnâ€™t like them. ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸</p>

<p>And, you should be grateful to:</p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ the person who told you canâ€™t do it - you started believing in yourself even more</p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ all the friends and classmates - they made that part of the life unforgettable</p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ the parents and teachers who scolded you - it made you disciplined</p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ the college senior who bullied you - it made you tough and sturdy</p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ the every other person that you ever met</p>

<p>There is a different perspective to look at the things; either in a positive way or negative, itâ€™s up to you.</p>

<p>Just #learn from things.</p>

<p>And, evolve. ğŸ§¬</p>

<p>PS: You should also be grateful to your ex (if any) - probably you met (or, will meet) a more compatible person due to her/him. ğŸ˜</p>
