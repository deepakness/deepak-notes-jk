<p>Think of it as a game that you have created for yourself. You set the rules and you determine the outcomes. ğŸ¤Ÿ</p>

<p>Do you want to win? or lose? â‰</p>

<p>You win, if you win. ğŸ¥‡</p>

<p>Start again, if you lose. Repeat till 1000 times or more till you win. ğŸ”</p>

<p>And remember the most important thing:</p>

<p>You cannot play all the games. Play only the ones which bring the most value to your life. ğŸ§¬</p>
