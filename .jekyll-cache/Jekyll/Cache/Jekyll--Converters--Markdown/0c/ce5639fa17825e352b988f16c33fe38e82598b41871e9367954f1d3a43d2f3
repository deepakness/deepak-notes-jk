I"x<p>By not introducing the offline mode, Notion is becoming scary.</p>

<p>On 4th Jan, it was down for hours and I couldn’t do a thing during that time.</p>

<p>The amount of personal and work related data that I’ve saved scares me even more.</p>

<p>Notion should immediately introduce offline mode.</p>

<p>Till then keeping a regular local backup is very necessary.</p>
