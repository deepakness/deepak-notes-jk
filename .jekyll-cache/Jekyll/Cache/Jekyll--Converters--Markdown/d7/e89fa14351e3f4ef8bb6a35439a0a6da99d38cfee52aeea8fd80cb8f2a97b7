I")<p>Itâ€™s better to keep publishing all the short/mini notes in a separate section on your website than to wait for the full article to be completed.</p>

<p>Just write down your quick thoughts about anything and publish it right away.</p>

<p>And, you can use that piece of writing to post on the social media or use it inside your full blog posts.</p>

<p>Like I would not procrastinate to write a simple 2-3 line notes on any topic. These writings of mine are stored in a single place and I can refer to them anytime I want.</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>
