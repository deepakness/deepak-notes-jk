I"©<p>Recently, I discovered a tool which lets you know exactly where do your emails land - inbox, spam/junk or promotions.</p>

<p>And, itâ€™s free.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s called <a href="https://www.gmass.co/inbox">GMass - Inbox, Spam, or Promotions?</a> and it works perfectly.</p>

<p>Just send the email to the provided email addresses and the tool will let you know where they landed, instantly.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s kinda awesome.</p>
