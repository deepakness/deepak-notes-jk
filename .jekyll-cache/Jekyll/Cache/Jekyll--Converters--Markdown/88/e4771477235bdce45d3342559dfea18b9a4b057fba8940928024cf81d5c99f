I"ˆ<p>Who are you?</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s your significance?</p>

<p>Ask yourself, â€œwho am I?â€ and you should get an answer back.</p>

<p>Before others assume you as lazy or good-for-nothing, define yourself. Because you will never fit in their definition.</p>

<p>They might call you â€œmy lifelineâ€ but thatâ€™s not your identity.</p>

<p>Brainstorm and discover within yourself.</p>

<p>Discover your potential.</p>

<p>Discover your passion.</p>

<p>Discover something youâ€™re good at.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t let others know you as a companyâ€™s employee.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t be in the crowd.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t participate in the rat race.</p>

<p>Be different.</p>

<p>Walk alone.</p>

<p>Life is short, utilize it in doing things that make you happy.</p>

<p>Lead your life in a direction where you see the future you.</p>

<p>Be independent, donâ€™t always be surrounded by your friends and family.</p>

<p>Get out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>Be hardcore.</p>

<p>Be badass.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, do it with full dedication.</p>

<p>Keep people around you happy and thatâ€™s what life is.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re awesome and the world needs you.</p>
