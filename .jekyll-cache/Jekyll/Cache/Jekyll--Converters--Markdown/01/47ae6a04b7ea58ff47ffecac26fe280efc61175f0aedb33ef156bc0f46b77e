I"’<p>I wish there was an app where I could follow all the social accounts of a person in a single place.</p>

<p>e.g. If I want to follow Bill Gates, then whether itâ€™s his Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or LinkedIn; I should be able to follow all the updates in a single app.</p>

<p>Wouldnâ€™t that be amazing?</p>

<p>Not sure how itâ€™ll be done; but itâ€™s pretty much doable, I think.</p>
