I"Á<p>I started writing 5 years ago.</p>

<p>To be exact, I published the very first article on June 21, 2015.</p>

<p>Now, I completely rely on it. It pays my bills.</p>

<p>Was I an excellent writer? No, I am still not.</p>

<p>Was it difficult? No, just a few hours every week.</p>

<p>But, it was consistent, for sure.</p>

<p>During the years, have started several websites; some worked, some failed but it was all worth it.</p>

<p>Learned so many things that I wouldnâ€™t have if I wasnâ€™t writing.</p>

<p>The only point Iâ€™m trying to make is that as long as you are working in the right direction consistently, you can pull it off.</p>

<p>Months ago, I shared a story on <a href="https://bit.ly/39h8puq">Reddit</a> explaining how working just a few hours a week can get you enough returns if youâ€™re consistent. It was kind of viral.</p>

<p>And, I donâ€™t just write; these days, I am learning to code as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, all I want to say is to keep working. Youâ€™re awesome and the world needs you.</p>

<p>PS: Hereâ€™s a link to my <a href="https://bit.ly/2UYZPYP">first writing</a> which was about Airbags in Cars. I donâ€™t write there anymore.</p>

<p>And yes, I am a Mechanical Engineer.</p>
