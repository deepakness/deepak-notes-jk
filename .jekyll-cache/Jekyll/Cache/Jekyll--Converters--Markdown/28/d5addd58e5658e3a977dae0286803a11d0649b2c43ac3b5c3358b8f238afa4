I"ç<p>Yesterday, Notion was down for hours and it got me searching for available automated backup options.</p>

<p>After researching a bit, I found a way and wrote an <a href="https://compile.blog/2021/01/06/automatic-notion-backup/">article</a> about it.</p>

<p>It explains how to setup automatic regular backup of your entire Notion account with GitLab.</p>

<p>After experimenting a bit, I was able to successfully set up the automation.</p>

<p>And, itâ€™s working perfectly. ğŸ˜</p>
