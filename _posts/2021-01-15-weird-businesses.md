$1,000,000 for waking people up!!! 😱😱😱

An online tool called Snoozester generated over $1,000,000 in revenue just by calling people at a specified time and waking them up. 💤🛌

You just have to set a time and a reminder message. Snoozester will automatically call you exactly at the specified time and read your reminder message using text-to-speech. ☎️

Very simple, right?

And, people actually pay for this.💰
