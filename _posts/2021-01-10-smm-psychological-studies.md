## the Endowment effect

When we own something, we tend to value it more highly. If we have to sell it, we want more than it is really worth.

- your customers attribute a higher value to things they already own
- ask for their feedback/suggestions and involve them on social media to increase their ownership in your product

## Reciprocity

We feel obliged to give back to people who have given to us.

- give something valuable to get something in return

## Consistency principle

We like to keep consistent what we think, say and do, and will change to ensure this is so.

- help current users/potential users create an expectation of what they may say or do

## The foot-in-the-door method

When asked to make a small commitment first, we are more likely to agree to a larger request later.

- The more frequently a customer opens your emails, downloads your content or goes along with your request, the more likely they are to comply with a larger request like sharing your content & inviting their friends.

## Framing effect

We react to a situation differently depending on whether we perceive the situation to be a loss or a gain.

- the words you choose and the way you frame your content has a direct impact on how they will react
- frame things in a positive light

## Loss aversion

We feel the negative effects of loss more strongly than we feel the positive effects of an equal gain.

- discover their challenges and reservations
- alleviate their concerns up front
- example: risk-free trial, money-back guarantee, remove the fear of loss

## Conformity and social influence

We change how we behave to be more like others.
