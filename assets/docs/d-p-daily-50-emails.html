Tyler wants to have wild and wacky conversations that reflect his interests, even if they repel the average listener. But by ignoring the wisdom of crowds, he’s attracted an ocean of like-minded super fans. ​</p> <p>When I swim, I either like diving into a freshwater lake, boogie boarding on violent surf, or floating in an ultra-salty area like The Dead Sea. Like water, writing comes alive at the extremes. Avoid brackish prose that tries to be everything to everybody, even though it means that most people will be indifferent to what you publish. ​</p> <p>Depending on the article, you can either write for yourself or one other person. Thinking about thousands of people at once will drive you crazy because you won’t know what to focus on. Don’t let a stadium of perspectives paralyze you. Pick one obsessive person to write for, and let them be a proxy for the kind of reader you want to attract. ​</p> <p>When I write for myself, I think about what I would’ve wanted to know six months ago. I focus on ideas that would’ve surprised me or saved me time. Since I’m an obsessive who appreciates depth, I include more detail than conventional wisdom would advise. But guess what? I don’t care. My writing is a protest against the superficial babble that passes for intellectual discourse and gives us all BuzzFeed Brain. ​</p> <p>When I write for others, I start the essay with their name at the top of the page. Then, I describe them in detail: “Kevin will swallow information faster than a lion can eat its prey, but only if you keep him entertained. He’s a well-read startup founder whose appetite for rigorous thinking is balanced by an impatience for hollow ideas. So get to the damn point. Don’t let him drown in the deep end of background knowledge, even if it means he has to look something up on Wikipedia.” ​</p> <p>The more you write for somebody with peculiar interests, the less you compete for their attention. I write for practitioners because they’re allergic to cliches and philosophers because their BS filters are more sensitive than an electric fence. Meeting the kinds of people you’d never meet in real life is the whole point of writing online, so escape the lukewarm middle and write for one obsessive person.</p> <h2 id="day-2">Day #2</h2> <h3 id="why-you-should-write">Why You Should Write</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Words are the atomic unit of the internet. ​</p> <p>With the stroke of a pen, you can build your network, improve your thinking, and create opportunities for yourself. ​</p> <p>Until now, the internet has connected us with people in our past. But writing online connects you with the people in your future. As Derek Sivers once wrote: “The coolest people I meet are the ones who find me through something I’ve written.” ​</p> <p>​Writing online is a guaranteed way to shrink the world. A well-written article can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well. Each post is an advertisement for the kinds of people and opportunities you want to attract, and if you have a voice, you can build a platform. ​</p> <p>In any field, the most successful people double as writers. Chefs write recipes, comedians write jokes, and entrepreneurs write business plans. The examples are endless. ​</p> <p>​Writing is like weightlifting for the brain. Just as you’ll improve your food diet if you start cooking, you’ll improve your information diet if you start writing. Testing the limits of your ideas is the fastest way to improve them and raise your intelligence. Don’t take my word for it. Listen to Jeff Bezos: ​</p> <blockquote> <p>People who write a lot, also listen a lot. They also change their mind a lot. Not necessarily with new data, but sometimes re-analyzing the same data. They also work hard to disconfirm fundamental biases.</p> </blockquote> <p>An empty white page is a mirror into your mind. When the ideas in your mind are clouded, so are the words on the page in front of you. Re-writing is re-thinking. It’s the best single best way to sharpen your ideas. And once your ideas are as clear as a Neiman Marcus mirror, you’ll be able to teach them to others. ​</p> <h3 id="the-lessons-in-front-of-you">THE LESSONS IN FRONT OF YOU</h3> <p>The internet is the library we always dreamed of. It’s a place to learn, network, and connect with experts. ​</p> <p>You no longer need to depend on an institution for a platform. You can build your own following now. Two decades ago, online publishing was limited to authors, journalists, and media moguls. Today, anybody can have more reach than the kings you read about in history books. ​</p> <p>Writers engage with reality like it’s a full-contact sport. It’s a collision between your mind and the world. Writers are professional observers. ​</p> <p>When you know you’re going to write, you change the way you live. You can no longer sleepwalk through life. The most powerful insights come from everyday experiences that people ignore. ​</p> <p>As Sherlock Holmes said: “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”</p> <p>​</p> <p>The best way to learn faster is to have a stake in the outcome. Risk awakens our learning muscles like a splash of cold water. If you want to learn to cook invite friends over for dinner; if you want to learn about stocks, invest in the stock market; and if you want to learn about an idea, publish an article about it. ​</p> <p>Instead of ignoring the mundane, writers welcome it. From the annoyance of a DMV line to the wrath of a torrential downpour, many of my best ideas arrive in moments of extreme inconvenience. Recently, during a cancelled flight in Washington D.C., I realized that airports are lawless places. You can sleep on the floor, put your feet on chairs, have dessert for breakfast, brush your teeth in public, or chug a Heineken at 7am. ​</p> <p>There are no rules. ​</p> <p>Like my delay at the airport, since each moment is a potential future sentence, writers live with more curiosity. From the beauty of morning light to the heat of the afternoon sun, they soak up the world with passionate intensity. ​</p> <p>Writing initiates the ultimate positive feedback loop. Online writers are rewarded with instant feedback, and fast feedback loops are the best way to accelerate your learning. Better yet, writing regularly will inspire you to live an interesting life. As your writing improves, so will the opportunities available to you.</p> <h3 id="how-to-start-writing">HOW TO START WRITING</h3> <p>Most writing advice is simple.</p> <p>​ Use stories to illuminate what you’re trying to say. Write in short sentences. Make one point per sentence. Communicate with a smooth and natural tone, as if you’re talking to a friend at a bar. If you have writer’s block, you don’t have enough notes, so rather than starting with a blank page, start with an abundance of notes. There you go. That’s just about all you need to start writing well.</p> <p>​ Don’t just write for yourself. Share your ideas by publishing them online. Writing in public is like inviting guests to your house for dinner. You have to clean and double check everything. Just like when you cook a meal for your guests, you try harder when others are watching and your reputation is at stake.</p> <p>​ As James Clear says:</p> <p>​</p> <blockquote> <p>If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly… Social pressure forces you to up your game.</p> </blockquote> <p>​ Demand for quality writing far exceeds the supply of it. Since people who don’t write in public are blind to the benefits, there’s relatively little competition for those who take the craft seriously. Good writing is rare. There may be more writing than ever, but most of it is shallow. People are bombarded with worthless ideas and the distractions of the news. They’re tired of clickbait articles, exaggerated political dramas, and attention-burning articles. People are starving for creators who speak with depth and nuance. That’s why everybody reads Wait But Why and Joe Rogan stole the culture.</p> <p>​ If you want to grow an audience, treat your readers like they’re as important as the Pope. Every paragraph, every sentence, and every word matters. Readers who feel respected will return to your website and tell their friends about your writing. Once you build the writing habit, you’ll be surprised by how easy it is to reach people.</p> <p>​ People dream of the advantages you take for granted. Writing is free. You already have everything you need: an internet connection and easy access to a computer. You pay in time, not money. The only thing standing between you and your writing goals is discipline.</p> <p>​ Learn to write.</p> <h2 id="day-3">Day #3</h2> <h3 id="the-serendipity-of-note-taking">The Serendipity of Note-Taking</h3> <p>​ I always write a shopping list before I go to the grocery store: eggs, salmon, steak, pasta, greek yogurt. You know, the usual. But somehow, I always buy something I didn’t expect. Last time, it was NutZo almost butter. The time before that, fresh figs.</p> <p>​ My grocery experience falls into two categories: remembering the specifics and following serendipity. I see the same buckets whenever I use my note-taking system to write an essay.</p> <p>​ Your note-taking system shouldn’t just help you save ideas. It should help you generate new ones too. Let’s pretend I’m writing about NASA’s Apollo 8 mission. I’ll start the research process by looking up notes from my favorite book about it: Rocket Men. Within 30 seconds, I find specific details: the Saturn V rocket reached speeds of 24,208 miles per hour and the moon is 238,900 miles away from Earth, roughly 58 times the distance Columbus sailed when he discovered the Western world. But just as the best part of going to the grocery store is finding things you never expected to buy, note-taking comes alive when you transcend the limits of memory and step into a galaxy of surprising ideas.</p> <p>​ Good note-taking systems help you discover ideas like grocery stores do with food. When they do, your writing can travel in a new, more productive direction. But too many people try to make their note-taking systems too orderly, which reduces the serendipity that makes note-taking so useful in the first place. Order is a tradeoff. Even though it helps you find what you’re looking for, it reduces creativity-inspiring randomness.</p> <p>​ Returning to the Apollo 8 example, a tour through my notes reveals a mind-bending statistic about the New Horizons spacecraft which took 9.5 years to travel 3 billion miles and reach Pluto within 1 minute of the time NASA predicted when it launched. Then, it reminds me of two stories: the time I visited Cape Canaveral with my father or the time I saw the Apollo command module at the National Air and Space Museum. Within two minutes, I’ve fallen into a black hole of stories I’d forgotten. Rather than being disappointed by my ever-decaying memory, I am propelled by the compounding advantages of a notes collection which numbers in the thousands.</p> <p>​ It turns out, I’m not the only person who buys things impulsively. One University of Pennsylvania study found that 1/5th of in-store purchases are unplanned, which is why American consumers spend $5,400 per year on impulse purchases. Just as a retail store is as profitable as its ability to generate unplanned purchases, your note-taking system is as useful as its ability to generate serendipity.</p> <h2 id="day-4">Day #4​</h2> <h3 id="writing-is-more-than-typing">Writing is More than Typing</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Jiro Dreams of Sushi is my favorite documentary. ​</p> <p>It tells the story of an 85-year-old sushi master who runs a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Tokyo. President Obama said it was the best sushi he’s ever had. The most surprising part of the documentary is seeing how little running a restaurant has to do with cooking. For example, my favorite scene occurs at the Tsukiji fish market, where his team sources fresh fish every day.</p> <p>​ No matter the restaurant, preparation begins a long time before fire lines the stove. In the culinary tradition, chefs follow a French system called mise-en-place which translates to “everything in its place.” At fancy restaurants, it begins many hours before the first guests arrive.</p> <p>​ When I was living in New York, I often worked out of a high-end Manhattan restaurant called Aldea which doubled as a co-working space on weekdays. Kitchen setup began at 10:30am — seven hours before the first guests arrived. During preparation, they deboned their meats, separated vegetables into small bowls, and segmented the soups into marked boxes. Their daily preparation lasted longer than the restaurant’s opening hours.</p> <p>​ Just as cookbooks won’t train somebody to run a restaurant, traditional writing books won’t train people to write online. Spelling, grammar, and sentence structure are only a fraction of what writers think about. The online writing experience extends to sourcing ideas, taking notes, having conversations, managing emotional turmoil, putting words on the page, distributing your essays, and building an audience. Every exceptional writer I know has their own version of sourcing fish from the market or mise-en-place.</p> <p>​ The language of high-end dining demonstrates how a chef’s responsibilities go beyond the act of cooking. The English word for chef translates to “chief of the kitchen” in French. That chef de cuisine is responsible for creating menus, preparing the food, plate design, managing kitchen staff, ordering equipment, and controlling the ambiance. All those activities fall under the bucket of cooking. Only after they’re all complete does food preparation begin. Just as cooking is only part of what it means to be a chef, typing is only a fraction of what it means to be a writer.</p> <h2 id="day-5">Day #5</h2> <h3 id="writing-makes-you-a-better-speaker">Writing Makes You a Better Speaker</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Neil deGrasse Tyson once told me that he’s already written down practically everything he says in public. At the time, I thought it was BS. Now I know it’s true. By writing frequently he’s honed his ability to speak rhythmically and become America’s most eloquent scientist. ​</p> <p>He sees pop culture as a scaffold to support explanations about the universe: “I found myself with a foot in pop culture and a foot in my field… Think of it as a communication scaffold. Now you have information in your field that you then attach to that scaffold, and the person just receives it without hesitation and without jumping over hurdles.” ​</p> <p>It’s not enough to write. You have to write publicly. As the author of more than 10 books, he has a well of already-written stories and statistics to draw upon. Only then can you anticipate counter-arguments and understand how subtle tweaks in your diction influence the potency of your ideas. ​</p> <p>In addition to style, writing sharpens the substance of his ideas. Unlike speech, words on the page can be reworked and rewritten until they’re clear and concise. By the time he sits down for an interview, the hard work of thinking is complete and he turns into a carrier for ideas he’s already penned. If you want to become a better speaker, start by writing every day.</p> <h2 id="day-6">Day #6</h2> <h3 id="note-taking-is-time-travel">Note-Taking is Time Travel</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Have you ever looked at photos from an old trip? Doing so brings back all kinds of forgotten memories. Find a photo of the dinner you had in Prague, and you’ll remember the delicious fish you ate, which will remind you of the charming Airbnb you rented, which will remind you of the graffiti on the John Lennon Wall, which will remind you of the friends you walked with on the St. Charles bridge. ​</p> <p>You get the point. Memories unlock memories. Photos don’t just remind you of what you captured. They elicit memories of the other places you visited, the people you were with, and the emotions you felt while traveling. ​</p> <p>​Note-taking works the same way. It’s not just about saving quotes and shopping lists. It’s about having conversations with your past and future self so you can develop ideas over time. The Grammy Award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar once explained how note-taking is the closest thing we have to time travel: ​</p> <p>“I have to make notes because a lot of my inspiration comes from meeting people or going outside the country, or going around the corner of my old neighborhood and talking to a five-year-old little boy. And I have to remember these things. I have to write them down and then five or three months later, I have to find that same emotion that I felt when I was inspired by it, so I have to dig deep to see what triggered the idea… It comes back because I have key little words that make me realize the exact emotion which drew the inspiration.”</p> <p>​</p> <p>Kendrick doesn’t write down all his ideas. That’d take too long. Instead, he captures just enough to return to his emotional state when he wrote those notes. Like a journey through old photos, those snippets trigger a memory cascade and a torrent of buried emotions. Without those notes, his observations would evaporate faster than he can rap about them. But words on the page have infinite patience. By taking notes, Kendrick travels through time and rebels against the entropy of memory.</p> <h2 id="day-7">Day #7</h2> <h3 id="learn-to-write-fast">Learn to Write Fast</h3> <p>​</p> <p>School may have taught you to write, but it probably didn’t teach you to write fast and once you start working, you routinely write under deadlines. ​</p> <p>I learned this at my first job when the average writing assignment was due “by the end of the day.” Unlike school, time to research wasn’t built into the calendar so I was always pressed for time. ​</p> <p>Writing against the clock is much easier when you have a note-taking system. As author David Allen once said: “Minute-to-minute and day-to-day you don’t have time to think. You need to have already thought.” Building a Second Brain is the best way to leverage the thinking you’ve already done. Instead of writing from scratch, you can create an outline by collecting your most relevant ideas from books you’ve already read, conversations you’ve already had, and evergreen notes you’ve already written. Like alchemy, the article’s structure comes together organically once you’ve compiled enough ideas. This is when most people start writing, but talking about your ideas is a faster way to concretize your structure. ​</p> <p>Talking forces you to structure your ideas because it happens at the speed of thought. Set a three minute timer, pretend like you’re talking to a friend, and explain what you want to write. As you do, transcribe your words with Otter. Often, it helps to repeat the exercise because doing so refines your thesis. If you’re feeling ambitious, take time off the clock every time you re-explain your ideas. By the time you’re done recording yourself, you’ll have your structure organized and the ideas externalized. Only then should you start typing. ​</p> <p>I’m not saying you should always write fast. Some essays demand contemplation. In my own writing practice, all my long-form essays take more than 100 hours to write. But just as drills can build an athlete’s skill set, every writer should practice writing fast. ​</p> <p>At most, writing fast will vastly increase your earnings power because writing well is thinking well, and people who write fast, think fast. At the very least, by forcing you to build a note-taking system and structure your ideas by talking, tight deadlines will make your process more efficient. And if you’re wondering, I wrote this article in 94 minutes.</p> <h2 id="day-8">Day #8</h2> <h3 id="writing-can-save-you-time">Writing Can Save You Time</h3> <p>​</p> <p>People don’t write because it “takes too long.” Typing and editing is too much work, so they don’t put their best ideas on paper. This strategy saves time in the short term, but over the long term, it hurts them. ​</p> <p>Writing can save you time. Publishing ideas on paper is how you create intellectual capital because writing is how you make your ideas permanent. Words on paper are the closest thing we have to time travel. Once you write something down, you can remix and reuse the ideas for the rest of your life.</p> <p>​ Writing is research and development for your brain. The words you publish now are the seeds of your future projects. Every time you write down an idea, you add a Lego block to your intellectual arsenal. The more Legos you have, the more things you can build. Writing is the same. The more you write now, the more you can create in the future. As the number of artifacts you create increase linearly, the number of connections you make between them increase exponentially.</p> <p>​ Starting a project when you’re a prolific writer is like running a marathon and starting at the 24-mile marker. You’ve already done most of the work. You don’t need to research, think of a new framework, or scavenge your memory for that great idea you once had but can’t remember anymore.</p> <p>​ I’ve gotten to the point where I only say yes to projects I’m 80% done with. I only say yes to projects I can mostly tackle with Lego blocks I’ve already created. That intellectual capital took a long time to build, but since I can reuse the ideas forever, all those Lego blocks will save me thousands of hours over the course of my career.</p> <h2 id="day-9">Day #9</h2> <h3 id="learn-like-an-athlete">Learn Like an Athlete</h3> <p>​</p> <p>LeBron James didn’t always have thick calves, a raging six-pack, and arms like the Incredible Hulk. ​</p> <p>Ask LeBron about his off-season training regimen, and he’ll share a detailed run-down of his workout plan and on-the-court practice routine. When he entered the NBA, LeBron wasn’t a strong shooter. I’d bet the house that early in his career, LeBron built his off-season training regimen around his weak jump shot and disappointing 42% field goal percentage during his rookie season. As his Instagram posts reveal, LeBron worked for his strength, agility, impeccable history of injury avoidance, and an outstanding 54% field goal percentage during his 14th NBA season.</p> <p>Athletes train. Musicians train. Performers train. But knowledge workers don’t. ​</p> <p>Knowledge workers should train like LeBron, and implement strict “learning plans.” To be sure, intellectual life is different from basketball. Success is harder to measure and the metrics for improvement aren’t quite as clear. Even then, there’s a lot to learn from the way top athletes train. They are clear in their objectives and deliberate in their pursuit of improvement. ​</p> <p>Knowledge workers should imitate them.</p> <p>​</p> <h3 id="what-does-a-learning-plan-look-like">WHAT DOES A LEARNING PLAN LOOK LIKE?</h3> <p>​ Similar to how LeBron structures his training to win NBA championships, knowledge workers should train to build skills, complete projects, and increase their productive power. Armed with an effective system, we’ll learn faster and have more fun doing it.</p> <p>​ My friend Nick Maggiulli is a case study in building a learning plan.</p> <p>​ In 2015, he decided to learn a programming language called R. Two years later, he was a data science expert. That new skill propelled Nick into his next long-term endeavor, a personal blog. Nick started writing a blog post every Tuesday, starting on January 1st, 2017. Fast forward to today, and he’s now published a post every week for the past 131 weeks. Despite his success, his pursuit of knowledge is relentless. Last time I visited his apartment, I saw an 850-page book about tax law on his living room table. He plans to devote the next year to study the American tax code, so he can know as much about tax law as anybody at his company.</p> <p>​ Nick should serve as a role model for all of us.</p> <p>​ Even among the most ambitious individuals, learning plans are rare. Most people are reactive. They don’t plan. Like surfers in a violent ocean, they surrender to their environment. They direct their attention towards the never-ending shouts of email newsletters, friend recommendations, and social media feeds.</p> <p>​ We can do better.</p> <p>​</p> <h3 id="what-should-you-do">WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?</h3> <p>​ Learn in three-month sprints and commit to a new learning project every quarter.</p> <p>​ Even the longest projects are simply a collection of short term tasks. Knowing that, you should break down the project into daily increments, and create a series of daily and weekly goals to learn the skills required to complete the project on time.</p> <p>​ The end goal should be clear. Start by writing down a positive vision for your future. Focus on the end goal, not the skill itself. For example, rather than saying “I want to learn how to draw,” I focused on the end goal: “moving forward, all the charts, graphs, and images on my website will be hand-drawn.”</p> <p>I like Daniel Gross’ framework for learning. When I interviewed him, he told me to build a video game for myself. Like a video game, productive projects have multiple levels. They follow the Goldilocks Principle: not too easy, not too hard. The learning project needs to be challenging enough to demand focus, but easy enough to make consistent progress. That way, you can enter the optimal state of learning. ​</p> <p>If you get stuck, the “video game” is too hard. When this happens, you should stop. Work on a smaller step or retreat to a manageable challenge. Otherwise, you will lose your motivation to continue learning. Conversely, if you’re bored, the video game isn’t difficult enough, so you should attempt a tougher challenge that you haven’t seen before.</p> <p>​ Everybody loves novelty. Even if your learning plan is bounded by a strict goal, the details should be flexible. The activities should be cohesive enough to keep on track, but diverse enough to stay interesting. For example, if you want to learn about the Space Race between America and the Soviet Union, you can read books, watch documentaries, listen to podcasts with astronauts, and explore newspaper articles from the time-period. Choose what excites you, as long as it serves the end goal.</p> <p>​ I encourage you to share your learnings. Publish an essay, a book review, an art project, or open source your code. Sharing your ideas will help you digest them, and if your posts are interesting, you may attract experts in your field of curiosity.</p> <p>​ If you can publish your findings along the way, even better. Sharing your work is the best way to speed up your feedback loops, which will help you learn faster and improve your plan based on the feedback you receive. For example, I’m learning to draw, and that’s why I’ve included drawings in this article.</p> <p>​ If you want to learn to code, post your software on Github; if you want to learn guitar, share your music on Instagram; and if you want to improve your writing, start a blog. Sharing your work is like inviting friends to your home. It forces you to be clean and double check everything, which accelerates the learning process.</p> <p>​</p> <h3 id="learn-like-an-athlete-1">LEARN LIKE AN ATHLETE</h3> <p>​ The more you learn, the easier it is to learn. Pick the right projects, and you’ll develop a personal network effect, where each new skill increases the value of skills you already have.</p> <p>​ You’ll improve your process every time you complete a learning challenge. By pushing through the cycle of start to finish, you’ll discover quirks about yourself, accelerate your learning process, and ultimately, learn like an athlete.</p> <h2 id="day-10">Day #10</h2> <h3 id="the-three-bs-of-creativity">The Three B’s of Creativity</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Creativity is serendipitous, but that doesn’t make it magic.</p> <p>​ “Thinking harder” is not a recipe for creativity. More effort won’t necessarily lead to better ideas. Instead, creativity tends to arise in states of relaxation which are preceded by a long period of focused thinking. Although you can’t will yourself into creativity, you can create the conditions for it by following the Three B’s of Creativity: bed, bath, and bus.</p> <p>​ Bed represents sleep. It’s a chance to put your subconscious mind in control of your thoughts. Closing your eyes is like restarting an overloaded computer. By the time you wake up, you’ve synthesized the ideas you’ve been thinking about and cleaned the windows of your mind. The artist Salvador Dali used to fall asleep after long spurts of work with a ball in his hand, hoping that it’d fall and wake him up just as he was entering a dream state. By falling asleep, his mind left the logical realm and entered an imaginative one.</p> <p>​ Bath represents leisure. My roommate is a mathematician and whenever he’s stuck on a problem, he cracks open a beer and watches a TV show. The context switch calms his mind and within 30 minutes, he’s usually writing down solutions he wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Baths are one of the few places in the world where people aren’t absorbed by the drama of entertainment or the pings of technology, and only once those disappear can they hear themselves think.</p> <p>​ Bus represents movement. It’s why Jack Kerouac spent so much time driving between American coasts that it looked like he was playing ping pong with his car. It’s why, when I was living in New York, I insisted on working from a new neighborhood every day. Bus is also why so many people write while they walk. As Morgan Housel said in my interview with him: “I walk a lot. Several times a day, just around my block. My neighbors probably think I’m crazy. But I think so much clearer when I’m walking. It’s where I ‘write’ most of my stuff.”</p> <p>​ Together, the trinity of bed, bath, and bus reveals that creativity favors the unfocused and unconcentrated mind. When you follow them, creativity goes from being a mystical talent to a conscious way of being.</p> <h2 id="day-11">Day #11</h2> <h3 id="you-already-have-a-voice">You Already Have a Voice</h3> <p>​ Your “voice” is just your personality on the page. In life, you are born with certain behavioral patterns. Within a few years, your parents can already see the outlines of who you’ll become. As you get older, you feel the itch to leave the house because you know that lived experiences will help you grow into yourself. You fall, get hurt, get back up, and keep going. Just as you don’t wait to leave home until you’ve found your personality, you shouldn’t wait to start writing until you’ve found your voice. ​</p> <p>Maybe you don’t write because you don’t feel talented enough. Maybe, you got a C in high school English class and think that just because you can’t write like Joan Didion, you shouldn’t write at all. But that’s like going to the driving range, hitting a bad shot, and never golfing again just because you can’t play like Tiger Woods. ​</p> <p>Or maybe, you don’t feel unique enough. You say: “All my interesting ideas have already been written about.” I’ve heard that line from some of the most creative and idiosyncratic people I know, and it’s nonsense. In person, they know they’re unique. They’re even proud of their differences. But once it’s time to write, they develop an existential fear of not being original enough and compensate by writing like a try-to-impress-everybody consultant with the personality of a doorknob. ​</p> <p>Your voice won’t reveal itself until you drop the consultant-speak and listen to the whispers of your intuition. Somehow, it already knows who you want to become. As economist Tyler Cowen said: ​</p> <p>It’s the weird that’s truly normal. It’s how people actually are—what they really care about. In a sense, you’re getting them out of the weird. The weird is the stage presence we put on—all the ‘puffery’ and unwillingness to say what you really think.</p> <p>​</p> <p>I have yet to meet somebody who isn’t exceptionally weird once I’ve gotten to know them. Sure, some people are weirder than others but everybody is strange and one-of-a-kind. The difference between them is that some lean into their quirks, while others run away from them. Once your compass points in the “I want to be less like other people” direction, you’re on your way to finding your voice. ​</p> <p>Everybody has a voice, just like everybody has a personality. Both are a collection of all the ways you’re different, but they’re invisible until you socialize. Your best readers will be drawn to your voice, so nurture it with unique experiences and a cocktail of obscure influences. But your voice won’t reveal itself if you just sit back and think. You have to write and publish frequently. When you do, pay attention to the articles people resonate with and the compliments they give you. When they align with the voice you already have and the one you want to develop, double down on what worked.</p> <h2 id="day-12">Day #12</h2> <h3 id="look-for-things-that-dont-make-sense">Look for Things that Don’t Make Sense</h3> <p>​</p> <p>When the billionaire investor Sam Zell reads the newspaper every morning, he looks for things that don’t make sense. ​</p> <p>One time, he saw that a Starbucks had opened in Mongolia. He thought to himself: “Mongolia? I thought they drink tea. What’s with that?” He was so curious about the story that he flew to Mongolia to investigate the situation. When he arrived, he saw that Starbucks locations had opened next to mines, which hinted at China’s construction boom. By the time he left, Zell had prescient information about the future of the Chinese economy.</p> <p>​ Most people run away from complexity. When the world doesn’t make sense, they dismiss their ignorance and think about something else. But Zell does the opposite, which partially explains his success as an investor.</p> <p>​ In similar fashion, hedge fund advisor Adam Robinson once said: “One of the key things to investing is to be aware when you hear a voice in your head that says it doesn’t make sense. That’s where the gold mine is — things that don’t make sense.”</p> <p>​ When the world does the opposite of what you think it’s going to do, it’s not the world that’s wrong. It’s you. Things that don’t make sense are your best learning opportunities. The factor causing the world to behave differently than you think is more influential than all the elements you’re thinking about. Your confusion is an invitation to recalibrate your model of the world so it better aligns with reality. So when a TV pundit says it doesn’t make sense why a stock is falling, it’s because of an X-factor they haven’t considered. As Robinson says: “The world always makes sense. What doesn’t make sense is his model.”</p> <p>​ If you’re eager for writing ideas, look for things that don’t make sense. Behind them, you’ll find hidden chambers of knowledge that most people aren’t privy to. As a writer, you will derive the most meaning from essays where your final draft contradicts what you thought before you started writing. Since knowledge is social, the things that surprise you will likely surprise your readers.</p> <p>​ Unlike Zell, you don’t need to get on an airplane to learn about things that don’t make sense. You just need to open the Internet, browse your notes, and start writing.</p> <h2 id="day-13">Day #13</h2> <h3 id="lateral-thinking-with-withered-ideas">Lateral Thinking with Withered Ideas</h3> <p>​ Nintendo uses a product-development philosophy called “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology.”</p> <p>​ It led to the 20th century’s most successful game console: the Game Boy. One day, a gaming engineer named Gunpei Yokoi was commuting home on the train when he saw a man playing with an LCD calculator next to him. Unfortunately, Nintendo didn’t have the budget to push the technological frontier at the time, so they used old technology to innovate. So long as the gameplay was engaging, Yokoi believed that players didn’t care about technical details like colors or screen resolutions. Compared to its contemporaries, the Game Boy was durable and affordable, which removed barriers to entry for users and developers. People would play for hours because it used AA batteries that were cheap and easy to find. Today, the Game Boy has sold more than 118 million units.</p> <p>​ That same engineer also created three other popular products: Super Mario, the Nintendo Game and Watch, and the D-Pad — the four-way directional controller that has become so ubiquitous in the video game world. All three of them, along with The Game Boy, show how you can have cutting edge innovation without cutting edge technology. While its competitors tried to out-spend each other with fancy displays and advanced computing power, Nintendo combined readily available technology in new ways.</p> <p>​ The history of innovation is full of lateral thinking examples. The Dyson vacuum design was inspired by the way sawmills use cyclone force to eject sawdust. Henry Ford borrowed from two industries to design the assembly line: studying the watch industry led to interchangeable parts and the canning industry-inspired continuous flow manufacturing. Even Bitcoin, which some predict will become the most important technology of the 21st century, combined cryptography advancements made in the 1970s, with digital cash research from the 1980s, with cypherpunk philosophy from the 1990s, with digital cash experiments from the 2000s, which Satoshi Nakomoto cited in the Bitcoin white paper.​</p> <p>​ While writing, you can follow Nintendo’s methodology. While the rest of the Internet is talking about the latest Netflix show or the new book at the top of the New York Times Bestseller list, you can pull from old and under-valued ideas instead. Find classic movies through the Criterion Collection, classic speeches on YouTube, and classics that are free to read because they’re so old that they no longer have a copyright. Then, write about the intellectual phase transitions that emerge. I call this “Lateral Thinking with Withered Ideas.”</p> <h2 id="day-14---missing">Day #14 - Missing</h2> <h2 id="day-15">Day #15</h2> <h3 id="find-your-shiny-dime">Find Your Shiny Dime</h3> <p>​ Building model airports was my favorite childhood hobby. I had a collection of plastic airplanes and used a pencil and paper to draw the gates and runways.</p> <p>​ Each airport began with the control tower because everything in an airport revolves around it. But rather than modeling an actual control tower, I represented it with a shiny dime. Once I placed it on the floor, the entire airport came to life. Although I always started with a general vision for what I wanted my airports to look like before I started building, that vision always changed once the construction began.</p> <p>​ Now that I’m a writer, I start every article with the metaphor of a shiny dime. Like the control tower, it’s the centerpiece of my articles. It represents a tiny but detailed idea that’s easy to visualize. Psychologically, shiny dimes are a coping mechanism for writers who try to explain their entire worldview in a single article. They’ll talk about every company they’ve ever worked for, every book they’ve ever read, and every experience they’ve ever had until they end up with gigantic topics like “Everything You Need to Know About the Stock Market” or “Artificial Intelligence in the Digital Age.” Though it’s tempting to write a magnum opus, the lack of constraints causes the article to spiral out of control.</p> <p>​ This instinct to write about enormous topics is rooted in anxiety. Almost every writer is pressed for time and feels like they haven’t written enough. They feel like every article needs to be comprehensive because their friends and co-workers will judge them otherwise. But writing is like fitness. Consistency breeds success. Showing up every day, even in small doses, will lead to more progress than scattered, all-day workouts ever will.</p> <p>​ Like fitness, you won’t write if you’re overwhelmed by the size of your topic. A shiny dime is the smallest viable idea you can write about. As a rule, yours isn’t small enough until you can summarize it with a one-liner. For example, my article about “The New American Dream” orbited around a quote from Tyler Tringas: “The New American Dream is to build a profitable, sustainable, remote software business that can be run from anywhere, scales nicely, and prints money.” I found freedom in the constraints of that shiny dime. Instead of pursuing an expansive topic like “entrepreneurship in the 21st century,” I rejected every idea that didn’t relate to the quote.</p> <p>​ Writing unlocks a kingdom of epiphanies you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. Paul Graham once said: “Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it.” Every topic is bigger than it seems at first. So instead of writing panoramic thought pieces, focus only on your shiny dime.</p> <h2 id="day-16">Day #16</h2> <h3 id="pop-writing">POP Writing</h3> <p>​</p> <p>You can evaluate every piece of writing with three variables: personal, observational, and playful.</p> <p>​ The pillars of my POP Writing methodology contrast traditional business writing education. In the office, people think they should use a heap of buzzwords and machine-gun fire of statistics, and dress it all up in an academic tone to make them “sound smart.” But these tricks are hollow. They won’t lead to readers who want to engage with your ideas or share them with friends.</p> <p>​ Find the balance of personal, observational, and playful writing instead. The proper weighting depends on what you’re trying to accomplish in your article. It’s like kitchen utensils where even though every home should have a spoon, you shouldn’t use it to cut a steak. In writing, what you need to graduate from Harvard Business School will be different from what you need to tell a funny story about your first startup.</p> <ul> <li>Personal</li> <li>Obeservational</li> <li>Playful</li> </ul> <p>Personal writing builds upon stories and emotions. It orbits around experiences you’ve seen with your own eyes or ones your readers have seen with theirs. Through shared feelings, it establishes an emotional connection between you and your readers. But too much personal writing can be intellectual junk food. It’s entertainment without wisdom just like tabloids and beach read fiction. Or, it can be like an unedited personal diary where the reader has to ask “Why should I care?”</p> <p>​ Observational writing happens when you notice patterns other people miss. It leads to the “Aha” moments that only come when you read something you’ve always known, but have never been able to explain. In practice, sharp observations are born out of the Three B’s of Creativity and looking for things that don’t make sense. Adam Smith mastered the art of observational writing when he wrote about the “Invisible Hand” in 1776, which is made memorable by anecdotes and playful metaphors. But observational writing is dry without personalization or playfulness. Like Darwin’s field notes, even though it’s profound, it can be a slog to read.</p> <p>​ Playful writing adds a shot of fun and enjoyment. It can come from analogies, thought experiments, or pop culture. Depending on the article, if you really want to be playful, you can use silly words like “slurp” or dad jokes like “Immanuel doesn’t pun—he Kant.” But too much playfulness will turn you into a clown. Richard Feynmann mastered the delicate balance in his physics lectures, where he lit up his students’ imaginations with concrete metaphors and examples that engaged all five senses. The playfulness of stick-figure drawings and goofy jokes is also why Tim Urban can make readers laugh while explaining artificial intelligence or the Fermi Paradox.​</p> <p>​ Unlike most writing frameworks, you don’t need to run to the keyboard to implement it. Instead, I suggest that you read your favorite writers through the POP Writing lens. Identify the balance of personalization, playfulness, and observation. Then keep the triad in the back of your mind whenever you write.</p> <h2 id="day-17">Day #17</h2> <h3 id="write-while-you-read">Write While You Read</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Make your reading more productive by taking notes while you read. ​</p> <p>For writers, reading is as much about sparking ideas as it is about consuming information. Descartes once said: “The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries.” If you’re reading good books, you’ll have your best ideas while you read. But most of those ideas disappear if you don’t capture them in the moment, while the idea is still fresh. But if you take notes, you don’t have to do the same thinking twice so you can build upon ideas you’ve already had. ​</p> <p>Your notes should be lightweight enough to write them consistently, but evergreen enough to stay relevant. Your teacher was right when she told you to take notes on what you read and put the ideas into your own words. Digital note-taking makes your reading time more productive by making your thoughts searchable. Unfortunately, apps like Kindle, Pocket, and Instapaper make highlighting too easy and don’t encourage people to write about what they’re consuming. Too many readers end up with a long list of highlights they never actually return to. ​</p> <p>Raise the difficulty of saving ideas and the productivity of reading by writing a short note about everything you highlight. Be selective about what you keep. Don’t just write a summary. Write about why each idea resonated with you and how it relates to what you’re working on. To make things easy for yourself, keep the notes lightweight and evergreen. Don’t spend more than three minutes on any individual note. Since they are the first draft of your thinking, they don’t need to be perfect. The optimal length depends on what you’re reading. Too short and you won’t have enough context. Too long and you’re not being selective enough about what to save, which makes it hard to read and difficult to browse your notes. ​</p> <p>Once you find the right length, make sure your notes are evergreen because you’ll be able to search them for the rest of your life. To make things easy for your future self, focus on timeless ideas instead of current events.</p> <h2 id="day-18">Day #18</h2> <h3 id="write-while-you-walk">Write While You Walk</h3> <p>​ Mary Oliver wrote most of her poems while walking. ​</p> <p>She rejected the assumption that you need to sit down at your computer to write. Every morning, she picked up her notebook and wandered through the nature beside her home where she captured what she observed. ​</p> <p>More writers would write like Oliver if they knew it was an option. Others know it’s an option but insist on struggling at their computer because “that’s what writers do.” English teachers tell us to write at our computers because most of them aren’t writers themselves, so they’ve never faced the I’ll-do-anything-to-fix-it desperation of writer’s block. They’ve never felt the agony of a mind that buzzes with ideas but shuts off when you sit at the computer. ​</p> <p>Writing while walking is the solution. As Morgan Housel, author of the Psychology of Money, said in my interview with him: “If I ever get some sort of writer’s block, or I’m just trying to think an article through, I go for walks. I go for two or three walks per day, and that’s where all of the writing happens, and I usually take notes when I walk.” ​</p> <p>Walking creates space for big-picture writing. It’s a time to generate ideas and organize the flow of your articles. I come up with my favorite sentences when I walk too, usually inspired by the podcast I’m listening to when I’m on the move. Whenever I write while walking, I have one rule: write down every epiphany immediately. Writing the idea down encourages me to think deeper about a topic if I have more to say about it or move onto something else if I don’t have much to add. My neighbors probably think I’m crazy. At the very least, they think I’m a smartphone addict who can’t move 100 yards without typing into his phone. ​</p> <p>Next time you’re struggling to write, close your computer and go for a walk instead. Depending on what your brain needs, you can listen to the sounds of nature or blast music into your eardrums. Get outside and wander. Like a good meditation, put your intuition in charge and don’t steer your thoughts. If you walk frequently enough and capture your best ideas when you do, you’ll shatter the chains of writer’s block.</p> <h2 id="day-19">Day #19</h2> <h3 id="create-a-physical-structure">Create a Physical Structure</h3> <p>​ When I was in 6th grade, I won a competition with friends by memorizing 17 digits of Pi. I was proud of myself until I learned that World Memory champion Gary Shang once memorized the first 65,536 digits. How did he do it? ​</p> <p>He created a memory palace, where he associated numbers with familiar places such as his childhood home. Instead of seeing abstract numbers, he saw concrete objects. By doing so, he proved that the strength of memory is malleable. With the right strategies, you can effectively raise your intelligence. ​</p> <p>Spiders use memory tricks too. Instead of creating a memory palace, they offload cognitive tasks to their webs which double as a second brain. Scientists still debate if spider webs are an extension of the sensory apparatus of their entire cognitive system, but agree that spider webs can process and simplify information like a computer.</p> <p>​ Like spiders and memory champions, writers can increase their cognition by externalizing their ideas. Doing so increases working memory. The term comes from computers, which use two kinds of memory: RAM (random-access memory) and ROM (read-only memory). RAM is like short-term memory that allows computers to store information about whatever they’re processing in the moment, while ROM acts like long-term memory that remembers things after the computer turns off. Externalizing the structure of your essay increases your effective intelligence by offloading your working memory to paper. Or, as Albert Einstein once said: “My pencil and I are smarter than I am.”</p> <p>​ I organize my long-form essays with Post-It Notes. I write one idea per Post-It Note, then hang them on the wall in my room. Doing so gives me the freedom to focus on one section whenever I write because I no longer need to remember the overall structure. How many Post-It Notes should you write? As many as you can process with a single glance, where each one represents one day’s worth of writing. Too many notes and it will take too long to process the structure; too few and you won’t offload enough working memory. For long-form essays, Post-It notes are better than linear outlines on a single piece of paper because they’re so malleable. You can change the structure of your essay by moving notes around instead of creating a new outline from scratch.</p> <p>​ Hanging notes on the wall makes your memory spatial. That’s why math teachers encourage you to use scratch paper. One study found that using pencil and paper to externalize ideas instead of only the brain reduced the time it takes people to multiply numbers by a factor of five. As Devon Zuegel wrote: “Mental multiplication is not itself difficult. What is difficult is holding the partial results in memory until they can be used. The visual representation, by holding partial results outside the mind, extends a person’s working memory.”</p> <p>​ Post-It notes help the most for books and long-form essays. Hang them on a wall you walk by frequently. That way, your subconscious can stew on the ideas while you’re away from the computer. Then focus on one Post-It Note at a time whenever you sit down to write.</p> <h2 id="day-20">Day #20</h2> <h3 id="talking-can-cure-writers-block">Talking Can Cure Writer’s Block</h3> <p>​</p> <p>I used to suffer from terrible writer’s block.</p> <p>​ Ideas buzzed through my mind whenever I spoke with friends or walked around New York City. But my brain turned off once I started typing. To be creative, I had to be on the move or in dynamic conversation. But at the computer, my mind stopped working.</p> <p>​ Desperate for a solution, I generated ideas by talking. I outlined my first popular long-form essay What the Hell is Going On by recording myself talk about the thesis for 15 minutes. I used an app called Otter to instantly transcribe my ideas, which I transferred to my computer and used to outline my essay.</p> <p>​ Talking to myself can be generative, but most of my new ideas come from conversations with friends. I’ve written numerous articles with Nik Sharma and whenever we see each other, we record our conversations. Pressing the record button is like a challenge to come up with new ideas. With instant transcription, our comments become the raw material for articles. When we’re done talking, we copy-and-paste the transcript into a Word Document, think of a thesis, and rearrange the ideas until we have an outline.</p> <p>​ If transcribing your voice doesn’t feel like pure writing, remember that Winston Churchill did most of his writing by dictating his thoughts to a secretary who typed his ideas for him. Then, once his ideas were on the page, he revised them. If it wasn’t above Churchill, it isn’t above you.</p> <p>​ If sitting at a computer kills your creativity, talk to your phone and transcribe what you say until you have enough ideas to write.</p> <h2 id="day-21">Day #21</h2> <h3 id="assume-youre-not-original">Assume You’re Not Original</h3> <p>​</p> <p>My favorite Derek Sivers article is called “Assume You’re Below Average.”</p> <p>​ Most people think they’re better than others, so he cites statistics like “Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than the average cancer patient” and “Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average teachers.” But Sivers does the opposite. Assuming he’s below average encourages him to ask questions and listen more. Here’s how he justifies the mindset shift: “To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments.”</p> <p>​ There’s a parallel for online writing: Assume you’re not original. Assume you’re a rampant copycat with no capacity for independent thought. You’re a robot who mirrors your inputs. You produce what you consume, and no matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to generate new ideas. Here’s the “evidence” you need to realize you’re a copying machine: In Shakespeare’s time, the word “ape” meant both “primate” and “to imitate.” The philosopher Rene Girard argued that humans are giant imitation machines and Harvard anthropologist Joseph Henrich even argues that our imitative capacities are the “secret of our success.” The urge to copy is in our DNA.</p> <p>​ But how can you have unique ideas if you’re not capable of being original?</p> <p>​ Use the Internet to curate your intellectual environment so you can copy the sliver of people who don’t copy people. As Tyler Cowen said: “What we’re trying to do with the web is we’re trying to mimic the cognitive strengths of autistic people.” Usually, those influences will be neuro-diverse with disabilities like ADHD and autism. While most of the world (especially the educational establishment) sees these traits as flaws to be cured, you should see them as talents to be nurtured.</p> <p>​ Autistics, for example, are natural cosmopolitans who are less likely to think in narratives or be fooled by endowment effects. They have gifts for pattern recognition, information collecting, and noticing small details, so they classify the world in unusual ways. They’re especially good at seeing details other people miss.</p> <p>​ As autistic writer Naoise Dolan once wrote: “As a novelist, I find my autism is often an enormous strength. Many aspiring writers get caught up in what other people think of them… Autism makes it much easier to disregard all that.”</p> <p>​ My favorite example of neurodiversity as a strength is Stephen Wiltshire, an artist who was diagnosed with autism at age three and is now famous for reproducing detailed scenes from memory. It’s a gift as much as a disability.</p> <p>Other examples of geniuses who showed signs of autism include Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and Nikola Tesla.</p> <p>​ Society has traditionally rewarded people who fit in, but the Internet rewards people who stand out with vivid Personal Monopolies. Rather than trying to find original ideas on your own, surround yourself with people who are missing the imitation gene and have a genetic disposition for originality. Then, build upon their best ideas.</p> <h2 id="day-22">Day #22</h2> <h3 id="write-about-earned-secrets">Write About Earned Secrets</h3> <p>​</p> <p>The intellectual world is like a map. Whenever you share an idea, you improve the map of knowledge either by clarifying ideas that have already been mapped or by expanding the map with new information. If you want to create new knowledge, you need an earned secret.</p> <p>​ Earned secrets are ideas that only you can write about. They’re valuable because they can only be acquired via circumstance or hard work. The world is filled with secrets waiting to be found, but by definition, I don’t know what they are. As Peter Thiel wrote in Zero to One: “The big secret is that there are many secrets left to uncover. There are still many large white spaces on the map of human knowledge. You can go discover them. So do it. Get out there and fill in the blank spaces. Every single moment is a possibility to go to these new places and explore them.”</p> <p>​ Earned secrets come in two flavors: access and revelation. Access helps you find ideas that other people couldn’t have discovered, while revelation opens your eyes to the secrets hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>​ Access comes from a unique perspective. They’re valuable because they’re rare. Often, they’re also confidential which makes them off-limits to write about. It happens when you have exclusive information that yields never-before-shared ideas that nobody’s ever written before. One example is the OKCupid blog which used proprietary data to explain the biology of online dating. In one article, they shared the three questions that best determine long-term compatibility between two romantic partners: “Do you like horror movies?” “Have you ever traveled around another country alone?” and “Wouldn’t it be fun to chuck it all and go live on a sailboat?” The more similar people’s responses, the more compatible they were likely to be as partners. OkCupid was the only company with access to the information they published, so all the articles contain statistics I’ve never seen before.</p> <p>​ Revelation happens when you synthesize public information in new ways, either because of obsessive research or a unique eye. Obsessive research works best when you write about ideas outside the spotlight. The media only covers a fraction of what happens in the world, so you can find new ideas by venturing beyond its narrow gaze and into the expansive realm of forgotten stories. Usually, the information will be public but scattered. That’s what happened with my Peter Thiel essay. Only after reading every word he’s ever published did I have an intellectual phase transition. Though all the information in the essay was public, nobody had read between the lines and written at-length about his Christian worldview.</p> <p>​ A unique eye is usually a byproduct of expertise. Perhaps, you’ve had the experience of reading about a subject you don’t understand, where you can only understand 10-20% of what’s being communicated. Experts have the opposite experience though. They pick up on more than 100% of the text because years of experience help them make connections beyond the words themselves. My favorite example is Stratechery’s Ben Thompson. In reading about technology for the past three decades, he’s developed a series of frameworks that help him interpret technology-related news. With a unique eye, he communicates what even the other experts miss about industry happenings.</p> <p>​ The secrets of access and revelation may be hidden, but they exist in abundance. As a writer, it’s your job to find them. You may even be unaware of the earned secrets you already have. If so, talking about your ideas will help you find them.</p> <h2 id="day-23">Day #23</h2> <h3 id="create-a-story-box">Create a Story Box</h3> <p>​</p> <p>All my designer friends are obsessed with Pinterest. ​</p> <p>It’s where they save ideas before they know what to do with them. It’s a productive platform because they add to their collection of images that resonate whenever they use the platform. Armed with an arsenal of images, they begin projects by scrolling through their collections of saved logos, fonts, and shapes instead of starting from scratch and praying for an idea to come to them. Designers aren’t the only creatives who collect ideas. Marketers have swipe files, songwriters have hook books, and artists fill their notebooks with sketches.</p> <p>​ As a writer, you should follow their lead and build a Story Box. The stories you collect can be from your personal life or the information you consume. Like Pinterest, focus on saving ideas that resonate in addition to ones that are immediately useful. But if a story makes you say “Wow” or rings in your mind for weeks after you read it, save it. Creating a Story Box is as easy as opening a Google Doc and populating it with every story that resonates with you, either with a short summary or a series of bullet points. With everything in the same place, you’ll be able to create intellectual serendipity for yourself.</p> <p>​ Scroll your Story Box whenever you want to write. If you’re hungry for inspiration, look for themes among the stories you’ve collected or the connections you can make to the ideas you’ve been thinking about. At other times, you’ll need a story to improve an article you’re working on where you’ve already codified the main idea but need a story to illustrate it. As you use it, you’ll feel the creative turbocharge that comes with having a Second Brain.</p> <p>​ Pinterest’s website says: When it comes to a great idea, you know it when you see it.” The same is true for stories.</p> <p>​ Start building yours by adding the stories you tell the most. If it helps, you can organize them into themes. Then add your favorite stories from books, articles, and podcasts. Don’t worry about your Story Box getting too messy because you can always search the document. And if you’re wondering how I found that anecdote about Pinterest at the beginning, it was inspired by an idea in my Story Box.</p> <h2 id="day-24">Day #24</h2> <h3 id="leave-a-summary-for-yourself">Leave a Summary for Yourself</h3> <p>​</p> <p>A large percentage of your success as a writer depends on one variable: How long does it take you to get into a flow state? ​</p> <p>Every writing process begins at the bottom of the Mountain of Agony. Depending on the day, it can take minutes or hours to traverse it. The climb is grueling because you can’t gain momentum until you reload the essay’s context into your brain and decide what you need to do next. In procrastination, you check Twitter, then your texts, then email. The more uncertain you are about what to do, the harder the climb will be and the longer it‘ll take to find your flow state on the Skyway of Satisfaction. ​</p> <p>On the Skyway of Satisfaction, you find effortless focus. As your ideas sing in glorious harmony, your fingers dance across the keyboard.</p> <p>The Skyway of Satisfaction ends when you stop writing for the day. There, you’ll find a parking lot. Unfortunately, most writers get right in their cars and drive away. But the great ones capture the view. They take three minutes to pen a 100-word note at the top of their page. They write about three things: where they’re stuck, what they plan to achieve next time, and what they were thinking about when they stopped writing. They do it right at the end of their working session, when their ideas are freshest. ​</p> <p>The note can be simple. For example, here’s what I captured from a recent essay.</p> <p>As a writer, your per-minute productivity hinges on how fast you can ascend to the Skyway of Satisfaction. As simple as it is, capturing the view from the top is a fast-pass through the Mountain of Agony and onto the Skyway of Satisfaction the next time you write.</p> <h2 id="day-25">Day #25</h2> <h3 id="the-islands-and-bridges-strategy">The Islands and Bridges Strategy</h3> <p>​ There are two kinds of articles: Clear Thesis articles where you know exactly what you’re going to say before you start writing, and Foggy Intuition ones where writing helps you discover what you think. ​</p> <p>Foggy Intuition articles are harder because you have to start writing before you have the answers. Since you don’t know how the ideas connect, you can’t make an outline either. You have to jump into typing. Only by creating an archipelago of ideas will you discover what you think. I know that sounds daunting, but you can usually write well about individual sections of the essay before you know how the ideas connect. ​</p> <p>Start by externalizing your disjointed thoughts on a subject. Even with this post, I knew that the two kinds of articles I discussed above (Clear Thesis and Foggy Intuition) were connected to the “Islands and Bridges Strategy,” but I didn’t know how to communicate the relationship between them. Instead of starting with an outline, I started with a collection of intellectual islands knowing that I could bridge them eventually.</p> <p>Get your thoughts on paper. You can write an unlimited number of islands. As you write your islands, reduce the interdependencies between them. That way, you can rearrange the order of the islands once you find a structure for your essays. If I want to create a physical structure, I’ll represent each island with a Post-It note and write about one island per day. To keep the sections modular, avoid referencing yourself with phrases like “earlier in this essay” or “in conclusion.” If you need them, add them later. ​</p> <p>Once you find a structure for your essay, link the islands with bridges, which are short transitions that connect two ideas. The longer your piece, the longer your bridges need to be. I write my bridges as late in the writing process as possible because writing changes my perspective on a topic which leads me to rearrange my islands. ​</p> <p>Just as entrepreneurs don’t wait to start a company until they know exactly how they’re going to build it, writers shouldn’t wait until they know exactly what every sentence is going to look like. By helping you write before all your ideas are clear, the Islands and Bridges Strategy will give you the license to tackle ambitious essays.</p> <h2 id="day-26">Day #26</h2> <h3 id="hide-your-work">Hide Your Work</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Your work is done when it looks so simple that the consumer thinks they could have done it, which means they won’t appreciate how hard you worked.</p> <p>​ Easy reading is hard writing. To write well, you must accept that you will only publish a small percentage of what you type. As Hans Hoffman once said: “The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.”</p> <p>​ Writing begins with a creation phase and ends with a deletion one. Removal is the essence of a final draft. Your scrap folder of deleted words, let alone all the thoughts you had before you ever laid your fingers on the keyboard, will always be longer than what you published. Only by silencing the part of your ego that wants to advertise your work ethic can you create a streamlined experience for your reader.</p> <p>​ With just three buttons on the iPhone, Apple hides hundreds, thousands of hours of human labor. Likewise, the math formula you memorized in high school was the fruit of centuries of human thought. Comedy, too. Watch a Chris Rock special on Netflix and you’ll see the well-timed jokes and the sold-out arena. But you don’t see the work. You don’t see the 50 performances he gave at small comedy clubs around the country, and you certainly don’t see the jokes that bombed along the way. It’s the un-natural grind of failing, failing, and failing some more that makes Rock look so natural under the bright lights.</p> <p>​ Elegance is the end result of hard work, not the starting point. Strive to make your work so invisible that the reader thinks they could have written what you published.</p> <h2 id="day-27">Day #27</h2> <h3 id="imitate-then-innovate">Imitate, Then Innovate</h3> <p>​</p> <p>To improve your writing, binge-read your favorite writers and shamelessly copy their style. ​</p> <p>Whenever I find a writer I admire, I mimic them in my next article. The words change but I follow the rhythm of their sentences and the cadence of their words. In Teaching Like a State, I copied the structure of the park bench scene from Goodwill Hunting, and my description of Peter Thiel as an investor, student, and philosopher borrows from the first page of Shantaram. Even this article is inspired by Seth Godin’s punchy writing style. ​</p> <p>Other writers copy even more. Hunter S. Thompson once hand-wrote every word of the Great Gatsby so he could feel what it’s like to write a great novel. Robert Louis Stevenson copied paragraphs from memory. He read his favorite ones twice. Then, he threw them to the other side of the room and re-wrote them without looking. ​</p> <p>Despite their success, writing is a rare artistic medium where copying isn’t encouraged. Musicians practice their scales because the architecture of sound comes to life not when you listen to great music, but when you actually play it. ​</p> <p>Painters copy too. My favorite part of visiting art museums is watching visitors sketch the paintings in front of them. Sometimes, they’ll spend a week in the same place so they can feel how their hands run over the canvas and watch how watercolor flows over the scribble-scrabble of an earlier sketch. ​</p> <p>I know a painting coach who tells her students to listen for resistance in the copying process. “Do you hear that?” she asks. “It’s the echo of your unique style.” Those moments highlight the second benefit of copying: it reveals your voice.​ ​</p> <p>Ironically, the more we imitate others, the more we discover how we’re different. There’s a long lineage of comedians who tried to copy each other, failed, and became great themselves: Johnny Carson tried to copy Jack Benny, but failed and won six Emmy awards. Then, David Letterman tried to copy Johnny Carson, but failed and became one of America’s great television hosts. Reflecting on his own influences, Conan O’Brien said: “It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.” All of them learned that imitation reveals our identity, especially when we fall short of those we admire. ​</p> <p>Instead of trying to be original, mirror others so intensely that the glitter of their brilliance shines upon your craft. It’s the closest you can get to a conversation with the artist. Aim for perfection but pay attention to your mistakes, for they hold the seeds of your individuality.</p> <h2 id="day-28">Day #28</h2> <h3 id="bring-a-unique-dessert">Bring a Unique Dessert</h3> <p>​</p> <p>If you want to make friends at a party, bring dessert. Don’t bring something standard. That’s boring. Bring something unique and fit for the occasion. A limited-edition flavor of Sour Patch Kids will be a hit at a 3rd grader’s birthday party, but it’s probably not acceptable for a black-tie awards dinner. If you want attention, decoration matters as much as taste. The more your chocolate cake looks like something you’d find at a world-famous bakery, the more popular it will be. No matter how good your cake is, nobody wants to eat a smushed up ball that looks like mud. ​</p> <p>Writing online is like bringing dessert to a party. You can either invent your own recipe or add a unique twist to a popular one, both of which I’ll explain below. ​</p> <p>When writing, look for in-demand topics that nobody else is writing about. At a party where people are only expected to bring appetizers, this is the ice cream in the heart of your chocolate cake or the Kahlua liqueur to match it. The biggest risk is that nobody wants what you have to offer. To solve that, look for an unnamed topic that people are already talking about. Then plant your flag in the middle of its orbit. That’s what Jason Crawford did with The Roots of Progress. But Jason believes that human progress is important and under-studied, so he started writing about the philosophy of human progress and built a reputation as “The Progress Studies Guy.” As a writer, he has almost no competition, but those who do should add a unique twist to a popular topic. ​</p> <p>You can succeed without being the first person to write about a topic, but only if you have a differentiated point of view. Bring a chocolate cake and that differentiation will come from colorful candles or frosting as ornate as a Moorish palace. When Ben Thompson started Stratechery, the Internet was filled with people writing about technology. But all that attention was focused on products, not the business of technology. Thompson had a unique perspective too. He’d spent the previous 20 years studying the industry, and that knowledge was furthered by an MBA from Kellogg. Inspired by Ben’s success, a Write of Passage alumnus named Packy McCormick started a website called Not Boring where he adds a funny pop culture spin to business analysis. Like anybody trying to add a unique twist, Packy’s biggest risk was a lack of differentiation. But he stands out with funny memes and a casual but intelligent flair you rarely find in business writing. It’s like Packy got tired of boring desserts, said screw it, and brought a piñata to the party. ​</p> <p>Avoid competition by bringing treats that everybody wants but nobody thought to bring. If you’re still worried about your cake standing out, tell your story. Maybe you can make your grandma’s favorite recipe. Or maybe, you can add homegrown fruits from your backyard garden. Whatever you do, bring a unique dessert and add a personal touch.</p> <h2 id="day-29">Day #29</h2> <h3 id="the-raymond-chandler-rule">The Raymond Chandler Rule</h3> <p>​</p> <p>The novelist Raymond Chandler used to write on index cards on his typewriter.</p> <p>​ He had one rule: something had to happen on every notecard. By following the rule, his stories moved at a brisk pace. For Chandler, it trained him to be crisp and direct. The online writing equivalent is to make sure your reader has an epiphany every 250 words. This heuristic makes your prose more concise, which increases the regularity of “woah, I didn’t know that” moments which make reading so enjoyable.</p> <p>​ My favorite example of somebody who follows The Raymond Chandler Rule without realizing it is 3Blue1Brown, a math-focused YouTube channel which explores complicated math concepts in 20-minute videos to a subscriber base of more than 3 million people. It proves that short attention spans are a myth. In actuality, opportunity costs are rising which means that readers are more likely to stop reading if they’re bored.</p> <p>​ The readers you want to have appreciate long, in-depth ideas, provided that they’re wrapped in a compelling narrative and come with a string of mini-epiphanies that work in harmony. In fact, my two longest essays: What the Hell and Going On and Peter Thiel’s Religion are the most popular ones I’ve ever written. It’s not that you can’t explore the depths of an idea. But just as good comedians nest mini-jokes inside of larger ones, good writers keep readers engaged with an epiphany every 250 words.</p> <h2 id="day-30">Day #30</h2> <h3 id="the-right-kind-of-original">The Right Kind of Original</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Yuval Noah Harari sold 12 million copies of Sapiens without adding any original research.</p> <p>​ He presented the literature in a new way and clarified it for normal people. While his success drives historians crazy, it’s a reminder that your writing doesn’t need to be 100% original.</p> <p>​ Every writer stands on the shoulders of those who came before them. A New Yorker profile about him says:</p> <p>​ It still astonishes Harari that readers became so excited about the early pages of “Sapiens,” which describe the coexistence of various Homo species. “I thought, this is so banal!” he told me. “There is absolutely nothing there that is new. I’m not an archeologist. I’m not a primatologist. I mean, I did zero new research. . . . It was really reading the kind of common knowledge and just presenting it in a new way.”</p> <p>​</p> <p>As Harari knows, intellectual progress has always been combinatorial. That’s why there are 1,010 biographies of Winston Churchill. Likewise, Star Wars borrows from ancient mythology, the Flash Gordon series of the 1930s, and Japanese movie director Akira Kurosawa. ​</p> <p>Harvard anthropologist Joseph Henrich has shown that the human species is successful not because any individual is so smart, but because of how we utilize collective intelligence. In his book, The Secret of Our Success, Henrich writes: “Innovation in our species depends more on our sociality than on our intellect.” Evolution selected for people who could acquire, store, organize, and retransmit cultural information, which is why humans are such imitative creatures.”</p> <p>​ Our obsession with originality comes from a fear of plagiarism that’s instilled in school. It’s a serious offense, but by focusing so much on it, we’ve paralyzed people. Terrified students confuse plagiarism with taking inspiration from somebody, even though they are wildly different. Plagiarism happens when you copy and paste somebody else’s ideas without attribution. That’s not okay. You can avoid it by following two rules: (1) if you use an author’s ideas verbatim, give the original author credit, and (2) when in doubt, acknowledge the source of your ideas.</p> <p>​ Academics are so scared of plagiarism that they commit another sin: triviality, where their ideas are original but irrelevant.</p> <p>​ If you insist on being original, aim to create an original premise instead of using only original ideas. Surprise people with a fresh premise and half of your work is complete. That sounds hard until you realize that every industry is focused on the same few discussion points. But spend enough time falling down the rabbit hole of obscure ideas and it becomes inevitable. For an example, look at my essay about Peter Thiel. The common narrative about him focused on his relationship with Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory, but nobody had written at length about his Christian worldview.</p> <p>​ Richard Feynman once said: “Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.” As a writer, your challenge is to look in places where nobody else is looking, so you can find worthy ideas that are hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>​ Sapiens is a best-selling book because Harari found a fresh way to present timeless ideas. Unlike most history books, it focuses on high-level generalizations instead of dense historical details. Reading the book is like riding on a tour bus and gazing at the ruins from far away instead of getting off to poke around them yourself. He entered the zeitgeist not by inventing big history, but by injecting it with futurology and self-help. And if you were wondering, this entire article is born out of two paragraphs in that aforementioned New Yorker profile.</p> <h2 id="day-31">Day #31</h2> <h3 id="intellectual-phase-transitions">Intellectual Phase Transitions</h3> <p>​</p> <p>In physics, a phase transition happens when a substance changes form. ​</p> <p>In your own life, they occur when you take ice out of the refrigerator, put it in a glass, and watch it turn into water. None of the original molecules change, but they turn into a new structure due to the temperature difference. The way ice becomes water echoes the words of French chemist Antoine Lavoisier who said: “Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.” ​</p> <p>Creativity is the same way. As a writer, you can transform existing ideas into epiphanies by combining other people’s ideas. That’s what happened with my What the Hell is Going On essay which has now been read more than 150,000 times. I still remember sitting in a Santa Monica coffee shop when I committed to writing a summary of Martin Gurri’s book, Revolt of the Public. I started by compiling my favorite quotes from the book. As I did, I saw how they connected to ideas from people like Marshall McLuhan, Jordan Greenhall, and Peter Thiel. The project changed shape. Instead of writing a summary of the book, I planned to synthesize all their ideas. By combining their ideas, I generated my own epiphanies until I discovered a narrative that only I could write. ​</p> <p>That originality wasn’t something I started with. It was an emergent property of studying other people’s ideas — an intellectual phase transition. Writing helped me digest the ideas and as I did, they began to change form. I started by writing a book summary but ended up with a thesis about how the current changes to commerce, education, and politics all result from the shift from information scarcity to information abundance. ​</p> <p>All creativity is inspired by other people’s ideas. The faster you embrace that, the more successful you can be as a creative. As Brain Pickings author Maria Popova once said: “Something we all understand on a deep intuitive level, but our creative egos sort of don’t really want to accept: And that is the idea that creativity is combinatorial, that nothing is entirely original, that everything builds on what came before, and that we create by taking existing pieces of inspiration, knowledge, skill, and insight that we gather over the course of our lives and recombining them into incredible new creations.” ​</p> <p>Consciously or unconsciously, all ideas are second-hand. You don’t need original ideas to start writing because novelty can emerge from other people’s thinking. If you don’t know where to start writing, start with a long list of other people’s ideas. Then, change their substance by blending them all together. Aim to find further connections between ideas and add them to your master list. Through combination and recombination, you will generate your own intellectual phase transitions.</p> <h2 id="day-32">Day #32</h2> <h3 id="summarize-the-canon">Summarize the Canon</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Every discipline has a book that everybody references, but nobody reads. In physics, it’s The Feynman Lectures; in philosophy, it’s Godel, Escher, Bach; in sociology, it’s Das Kapital, in English, it’s Infinite Jest; in communications, it’s Understanding Media; in biology, it’s The Origin of Species; in computer science, it’s The Art of Computer Programming; in investing, it’s The Intelligent Investor; and in economics, it’s The Wealth of Nations. ​ ​Build an audience by summarizing these books. By doing so, you’ll do yourself and the world a favor. You’ll attract an intelligent audience by saving people time and introducing them to important ideas. And besides, a good summary is often better than the actual book because it cuts the fluff, contextualizes the ideas, and makes them relevant. ​ But won’t the author be upset? No. You’re advertising on their behalf. Summaries are the same reason why electronic music festivals publish sets on YouTube. Recordings give people 50% of the fun for 1% of the work. The music is free, there are no crowds, and you don’t need to travel. But festival marketing departments know that people who watch the sets are more likely to attend in the future. ​ The purists in the house will hate on summaries. They’ll say you should only read first-hand sources, as if the knowledge you pick up in summaries doesn’t count. Though there’s wisdom in that perspective, they forget that summaries are an on-boarding ramp to reading the actual book, just music festival recordings. Eli Dourado’s summary of The Use of Knowledge in Society inspired me to read Hayek and I only read Seeing Like a State after Venkatesh Rao summarized it. ​ Look for the canonical books in your field. The ones that are hard to read but filled with foundational ideas, which is why they’ve stayed popular for so long. Old books are better to summarize than new ones because they’re more likely to stand the test of time, and the longer your summary will stay relevant in the future, the more you can justify the effort.</p> <h2 id="day-33">Day #33</h2> <h3 id="avoid-cliché-ideas">Avoid Cliché Ideas</h3> <p>​ Nietzche once wrote that certain kinds of metaphors are worn out, like “coins which lose their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.”</p> <p>​ Clichés work in the same way. They are colorless maxims that cause the reader to turn off their mind as soon as they see them. Phrases like “read between the lines,” “they lived happily ever after,” and “white people can’t jump.” They’re banal and every writer knows to avoid them. But cliché ideas are rarely discussed, even though they’re a worse offense.</p> <p>​ Cliché ideas are doomed from the start. They are trite because they align with conventional wisdom and the reader’s worldview, either because the topic is too broad or common knowledge.</p> <p>​ If you want to avoid clichés, don’t write from a 10,000-foot view. It’s like Google Maps, which isn’t relevant for daily life until you zoom in enough to see the roads and highways you need to reach your destination. Remember that metaphor whenever you brainstorm. Avoid high-level topics like “How the Internet is Transforming Society.” They’re fun to ponder but rarely detailed enough to be insightful. Look for second and third-order effects instead. In my own writing, the exercise has led me to “Audience-First Products,” “Naked Brands,” and “People-Driven Learning.” The more you investigate the details, the easier it will be to avoid clichés.</p> <p>​ Clichéd ideas are so obvious that you can’t possibly make the opposite argument. As cheap, copycat tricks, they put people to sleep faster than golf on television. Everybody knows that Amazon has been a good investment for the past five years and that the Internet plays a major factor in the rise of eCommerce. No shit, Sherlock.</p> <p>​ Avoid cliché ideas by writing about a familiar subject from a new angle. That’s what Tim Urban did so well in a post called Why Procrastinators Procrastinate, where he avoids standard methods of explaining procrastination by creating characters like the Instant Gratification Monkey and the Panic Monster. The ideas aren’t really new, but his humor makes the ideas come alive. You can also inject your ideas with life through personal stories. If it’s captivating enough, you can get away with a clichéd narrative arc. That’s why we watch romantic comedies even though we know the couple will eventually live happily ever after, and it’s also why 24 was my favorite TV show even though I knew Jack Bauer would save the world.</p> <p>​ Or, you can eliminate clichés by escaping the spotlight. Rather than writing about how Starbucks is a dominant coffee chain, focus on under-explored topics like how customers provide them with free debt or why they incentivize customers to purchase simpler drinks in the morning and complicated ones in the afternoon.</p> <p>​ Clichés are ideas without surprise, where readers can predict what the author’s going to say just by looking at the title. But insightful ideas are always jarring. By comforting the confused and confusing the comforted, they shock the reader out of an intellectual slumber. So next time you sit down at your computer, avoid clichéd ideas by zooming into a topic or adding a twist to a familiar subject.</p> <h2 id="day-34">Day #34</h2> <h2 id="write-a-summary-box">Write a Summary Box</h2> <p>​</p> <p>Every topic expands once you start writing about it.</p> <p>​ But sometimes, a topic expands so much that it creates writing sprawl where it grows so far that you can’t wrap your head around it anymore. Sprawl leads to confusion, and confusion leads to the kind of writer’s block that prevents you from writing anything at all. Eventually, a 500-word article called “What I Learned from My 3rd Grade Teacher,” which should take two hours to write, turns into “The Ultimate Guide to Childhood Education” which demands five years of research and a book-length treatment.</p> <p>​ To combat writing sprawl, I recommend nestling a Summary Box inside a Circle of Distracting Ideas. I’ll explain each phrase in turn.</p> <p>A Summary Box is like a scientific abstract, except it’s designed to keep you focused instead of helping the reader. It’s a 200-400 word summary of what you plan to write about. Like an abstract, it explains the core ideas without any of the nuance that makes the article worth reading. It sits inside the Circle of Distracting Ideas, where you drop all the ideas that feel important but are ultimately distracting. By writing them down, you give yourself the satisfaction of externalizing them so you can return to them in a future article, while also avoiding writing sprawl.</p> <p>​ Your writing process should begin not by typing, but by drawing your Summary Box. Once it’s complete, focus exclusively on the ideas in your Summary Box. Doing so will keep you focused because it’s an explicit pledge to not get sidetracked by distracting ideas.</p> <p>​ To be sure, I only use this strategy when I know what I’m going to say before I start writing. But the Summary Box is counter-productive for open-ended essays where you don’t know what you’re going to say before you start writing. For those, I recommend the Island and Bridges Strategy.</p> <p>​ If you’re struggling to write a Summary Box, pretend to have two minutes to explain your article to a friend. Then, transcribe what you say. For whatever reason, it’s easier to summarize ideas by talking instead of writing. No matter how you complete it, writing a Summary Box will make you faster by keeping you focused on your Shiny Dime.</p> <h2 id="day-35">Day #35</h2> <h3 id="the-but--therefore-rule">The But &amp; Therefore Rule</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the creators of South Park.</p> <p>​ They want each episode to have a sense of cause and effect, tension and rising action. To do that, they’ve studied the science of effective storytelling. They noticed that boring stories build off the words “And Then” while entertaining ones used “But &amp; Therefore.”</p> <p>​ They tested the epiphany with a giant whiteboard in their writer’s room. While storyboarding ideas, they removed stories where they wanted to put the words “And Then” between each section. For example, the story read: “Jimmy went to the mall, and then he realized he was tired when he stepped inside, and then he got a coffee, and then he walked back to the parking lot, and then he drove home.”</p> <p>​ Borrrrring. The story lacks tension without “But &amp; Therefore” moments.</p> <p>​ However, swapping the “And Then” moments with “But &amp; Therefore” ones improves the story. It reads like this: “Jimmy went to the mall, but realized he was tired when he stepped inside. Therefore, he picked up a coffee. But since he was tired, he had parked in an illegal spot. Therefore, by the time he returned to the parking lot, his car had already been towed.”</p> <p>​ Now, you have conflict. Jimmy’s car is gone and his day has changed for the worse.</p> <p>​ Visualize your stories with a whiteboard, an outline, or Post-It Notes. Identify the relationships between scenes in your stories and replace the “And Then” examples with “But &amp; Therefore” ones.</p> <h2 id="day-36">Day #36</h2> <h3 id="diversify-your-vernacular">Diversify Your Vernacular</h3> <p>​</p> <p>The most impactful piece of writing advice I ever received was: “Write like you talk.” Before that, I wrote to please my 9th grade English teacher. With it, my focus turned from trying to sound smart to injecting fun and freshness into my writing. My writing immediately improved. But now, I’ve realized the advice is ultimately limiting. ​</p> <p>When you talk, you can emphasize words with sound, speed, and body movements. Changing the tone of your voice can alter the meaning of your sentence. But writers have no such luxury. At the keyboard, you have to add meaning with fresh word choice. While talking happens at the snappy speed of conversation, words on the page have infinite patience. And while talking is like a live performance where you have to complete a painting in a single sitting, writing lets you paint over your mistakes until you reach peak precision. Sketch-by-sketch and layer-by-layer, you achieve a higher fidelity image of the world you’re describing.</p> <p>Writing like you talk is good advice because it forces you to write clearly, which is the first step towards improving your writing. But follow the advice too closely and your sentences will go stale. I realized this pattern while reading Rene Girard. His books are notoriously hard to read. They are high in word diversity, but low on clarity so I skipped right to his interviews. Most of them quoted him verbatim, so I slogged through them. But the best ones were groomed with the razor of a professional editor who widened the aperture of his vocabulary while maintaining the “oh wow, I’ve never thought of it like that before” punch that makes his ideas so profound.</p> <p>Whenever you write, there are three buckets of words you can choose from: (1) words people know and say, (2) words people know but don’t say, and (3) words people don’t know and don’t say.</p> <p>Pulling more from the second bucket will make your writing sharper and more descriptive. You’ll transcend the limits of speech while avoiding the trap of trying to sound smart by using $10 words that nobody understands. As a writer, time to edit is the biggest advantage you have over your talking self. Mine the depths of your brain for the illustrative language that hides in the chamber of “words people know but don’t say.”</p> <h2 id="day-37">Day #37</h2> <h3 id="fast-writing">FAST Writing</h3> <p>​</p> <p>School trains people to write slowly. ​</p> <p>Students who receive a syllabus at the beginning of the semester know exactly what they need to accomplish by the end of it. Teachers allocate time during the semester for outlines, first drafts, and final ones too. Students only begin writing at the end of the semester, after they’ve listened to the teacher and observed other people’s thinking via the books, articles and scientific journals they read throughout the semester. I call this SLOW Writing, which is an acronym for syllabus, listen, observe, and write.</p> <p>​ SLOW Writing only works if you can devote your entire life to the craft of writing. As a working adult, you can’t do that. Outside of work, you have limited time. You have chores to finish, kids to raise, and responsibilities to take care of. It’s not romantic, but it’s the truth: You only write if you can learn to write FAST.</p> <p>​</p> <blockquote> <p>FAST Writing is an acronym for find, assemble, speak, and teach. I’ll describe each step in turn.</p> </blockquote> <p>​ Find: Your process should begin before you know what you’re going to create. To do that, you need a note-taking system where you can save your best ideas. Without one, your research is a stressful process that only begins when you’re crushed by the weight of a deadline and know exactly what you’re going to write about. But armed with a note-taking system, you can passively research. Researching and living become one-in-the-same because you can collect ideas whenever you read, send an insightful email, or visit a museum with a friend. Finding ideas transforms research from an expensive exercise that you only do under the stress of a deadline to a passive activity in your normal life.</p> <p>​ Assemble: Don’t start writing from a blank page. Start by compiling a long list of scattered ideas that relate to your topic. With that long list in hand, you’ll be able to instantly ignite your creativity. If you have to start the learning process when you start writing, you’ve already lost the battle. FAST Writing doesn’t have a dedicated section for research because the vast majority of your learning should be complete before you start writing. Writing without notes is like trying to build a campfire without a pile of wood. Every time you run out of fuel, you need to run to the forest to gather more wood. But assembling your notes gives you a stock of firewood you can use to write your essay. You can distill them into a summary or use them to inspire an intellectual phase transition where you generate your own ideas.</p> <p>​ Speak: Writing is a high opportunity cost activity. It demands 100% of your attention and you’re exhausted when you finish because it makes you think so intensely. Speaking is easy though because you already do it every day. But most people don’t think of it as a way to develop their ideas before they start typing. Talking with others forces you to structure your ideas in ways that thinking alone never can because whenever you’re persuading or storytelling, you’re developing ideas you can eventually write about. The clarifying questions that arise reveal the holes in your argument that you can remove the next time you explain an idea. The more you can think in conversations you’re already having, the more refined your ideas will be when you start typing.</p> <p>​ Teach: One reason that students don’t like writing in school is because they don’t receive most of the benefits of writing online. For their entire childhood, they write for one person: the teacher. Good grades, an ultimately meaningless goal, are their biggest motivation to write. No wonder they don’t like writing. But online writing is a social and collaborative act. Sharing ideas with others turns teaching into a double entendre. First, you teach others about a topic when you share your ideas. Then, they reciprocate and teach you in return. The act of sharing ideas initiates a virtuous feedback loop where the better you write about a topic, the better the quality of feedback you receive, which in turn, helps you write better about a topic.</p> <p>​ If you want to write regularly, you don’t have time for the SLOW Writing methodology you learned in school. Your writing process has to fuse with your normal life, so you can write more while spending less time at your computer.</p> <p>​</p> <blockquote> <p>Find, assemble, speak, teach.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="day-38">Day #38</h2> <p>The Three Deadly Sins ​ Eliminate weak, wasted, and redundant words.</p> <p>​ Here’s how Gary Provost, who invented this framework defines them: Redundant words say the same thing twice, wasted ones don’t serve a purpose, and weak ones lack meaning.</p> <p>​ Weak words are like the difference between high-end sushi restaurants and American chains, where quantity is a signal of quality. For example, the 4.5 star rated on Yelp TexMex restaurant I recently dined at in Texas had a mediocre steak with sides of chips, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, cheese, sour cream, plantains, guacamole, rice, queso dip, and even more chips to go with the main course. All of it was meh, I didn’t even come close to finishing my food. A week earlier, a friend treated me to the finest sushi in Austin. Each dish was sourced from the finest fish markets, so the sushi was as small as it was flavorful and served a-la-carte.</p> <p>​ Two ways to remove weak words:</p> <ul> <li>Don’t write “Eddie was a kind, generous, and thoughtful person” when you can call him a “saint.”</li> <li>Don’t write “He passed away early in the morning, and people all over America cried” when you can write “He died at dawn and the nation wept.” ​ Wasted words slow the momentum of your writing. They’re like a pointless movie scene which makes you want to shout at the television and say: “Get to the point!” Eliminate wasted words by tapping your delete key more and moving your fingertips less. In writing, they come in the form of overused phrases such as “in the event of” (if); “on the occasion of” (when); “owing to the fact that” (because); “for a period of a month” (for a month). When you can combine multiple words into a single one, do it.</li> </ul> <p>​ Redundant words are like a restaurant where the hostess tells you the specials, before your waiter repeats the same spiel at your table. There’s no reason to repeat them, unless they’re uniquely complicated. In writing, your prose becomes redundant when you repeat something that’s already been communicated. As Gary Provost wrote: “Baby puppies” is redundant. A “little midget” would be redundant, as would a “big giant,” a “long-necked giraffe,” or “six a.m. in the morning.” “Red in color” is redundant because a thing can’t be red in size, shape, or age.”</p> <p>​ You can avoid these three deadly sins by compressing your sentences. If you can reduce ten words to five without altering the meaning of your sentences, do it. For a more intuitive approach, you can also improve your writing by writing entire sections from memory or talking about your ideas.</p> <h2 id="day-39">Day #39</h2> <h3 id="expression-is-compression">Expression is Compression</h3> <p>​ Experiences become shareable creations the way tree sap becomes maple syrup. ​</p> <p>It takes 50 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. So whenever I feel like I don’t have enough ideas to create something meaningful, I go collect more experiences and spend time processing them by writing and talking to friends. ​</p> <p>Even writers who work full-time spend most of their hours away from the keyboard. Full-time authors, for example, don’t actually type for 40 hours per week because they’d have little to say if they did. Instead, they spend most of their time collecting experiences. By the time they sit down to write, they’ve already experienced what they plan to write about, even if they aren’t entirely sure about what they’re going to say. By sitting down to make sense of their existing ideas instead of trying to invent new ones, writers at their computer mold the wet clay of experience into shape. ​</p> <p>When they succeed, their stories are well compressed. They’re tight, and the drama pulls the reader into the story as if they’ve been grabbed by the collar. We’ve all suffered those droning stories that lack the punch that defines good communication, and by extension, good art. Maybe you’ve heard grandma’s World War II stories drag on and on at the Thanksgiving table. Or maybe you’ve watched a movie whose plot moved so slowly that you fell asleep in the theater (that’s what happened to me during Hateful Eight. Sorry, Quentin Tarantino). ​</p> <p>If a story can’t get to the point, it will lose the audience’s attention. That means to ship something excellent, you have to be willing to cut what may have taken weeks or months to produce. As West Side Story composer Stephen Sondheim once said: “You have to throw out good stuff to get the best stuff.” ​</p> <p>That doesn’t mean that every story needs to focus on the climax. That’d be ridiculous. But as Sondheim indicates, the process of gathering ideas and distilling them into a smaller, more compressed form is the essence of creative excellence. ​</p> <h3 id="driven-by-compression-progress">DRIVEN BY COMPRESSION PROGRESS</h3> <p>​ Delicious syrup is the goal, but it can be hard to know where to find sap. Even when it’s right there, falling from a tree, it’s produced slowly. In the same way, when you’re a creator looking for ideas, daily life moves with tooth-gritting slowness. Sometimes, I wish I could speed life up to 1.25x speed to collect experiences faster. But no matter how hard I try, the hands rotate around the clock at the same pace. ​</p> <p>Like a maple syrup manufacturer looking for sugary sap, the best I can do is to get better at knowing where to find ideas that will improve my writing. But if you don’t know where you’re going, where should you look? ​</p> <p>A 2008 Cornell University paper called Driven by Compression Progress suggests an answer. The authors argue that people make sense of the world by making it simpler and more beautiful—by making compression progress. They assert that creators move towards compression progress not by following their rational mind, but by following their intuition for what’s interesting. In doing so, they compress large data sets into elegant deliverables which are easy to share and remember. ​</p> <p>When we make “compression progress,” we become like Nike, which compressed its entire marketing philosophy into three words: “Just Do It.” Or Nassim Taleb, whose succinct book Antifragile cites almost 500 books in the bibliography. Einstein, too, explained a large portion of how reality works a simple formula: E = mc². ​</p> <p>Einstein once said: “The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” In more modern terms, we remember Einstein’s words as “things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”</p> <p>​ Einstein’s compression is hard to see because it happened in the abstract, but Pablo Picasso showed the same process of compression in concrete form.</p> <p>In the <a href="https://dam-13749.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Picasso_taureau.jpg">image</a> above, Picasso aims to capture the essence of a bull. He ends with a collection of simple lines that illustrate the outlines of his beloved animal. But understanding of compression — and ultimately, the creative process — begins with a closer look at this series of images.</p> <p>​</p> <p>At the top of the page, Picasso begins by sketching a bull. Even though he wants to end with as few lines as possible, his 2nd and 3rd drawings are more detailed than his first one. The horns are sharper and the tail is defined with sharp contrast. Only around the 4th or 5th drawing, when Picasso breaks the body into parts, does the image become simpler than Picasso’s initial drawing. ​</p> <p>Crucially, Picasso couldn’t have started with the simple image that he ends with. Thinking so is the same fallacy that drives people to say “I could paint that” whenever they visit a modern art museum. Even if it’s true, it misses the point. Had Picasso started with only a small number of lines, just like the image he ends up with, his final rendition wouldn’t have been as pure. It wouldn’t have had the right rhythm or proportions between lines. Only by going through the process of compression can he find the ultimate distillation of a bull. ​</p> <p>Picasso’s painting and “Driven by Compression Progress”are a reminder that we should not worry about the productivity of our curiosity. By handing the reins of discovery to the wisdom of instinct and following the path of maximal interestingness, we can find the kinds of unexpected discoveries that yield compression progress. This, though is the paradox of creativity: your work is done when it looks so simple that the consumer thinks they could’ve done it, which means they won’t appreciate how hard you worked.​ ​</p> <p>Although the process of compression is useful, it’s unable to capture the finest pixels of reality. For example, MP3 file compression works by reducing the accuracy of sound in ways that are beyond the hearing capabilities of most people. Likewise, turning an image from a RAW file into a JPG works by reducing the number of colors in an image, but only in ways that are imperceptible to the human eye. Both forms of compression work by delivering an almost-as-precise end product that travels more efficiently than its uncompressed alternative. ​</p> <p>Compression can conjure the essence of an experience, but never the real thing. At best, their representations of reality can be useful because they distort reality. Sensing the inevitable shortcoming, artists are often tortured by their inability to describe what they experienced with the detail they felt in the moment. ​</p> <h3 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY</h3> <p>​ In Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll tells the story of a character named Mein Herr who makes an uncompressed map of the country that’s the size of the country itself. The map is perfect, but nobody can use it because it’s the size of the country itself. It’s a to-scale rendition of the landscape, but without compression, it’s useless. Unfolding it would cover the whole country and prevent the sun from even hitting the earth.</p> <p>​ Scholars have been grappling with this theme since Plato’s theory of forms. In his book Science and Sanity, philosopher Alfred Korzybsky wrote: “A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.”</p> <p>​ More recently, Rene Magritte highlighted the same phenomenon in his most famous painting, The Treachery of Images. Below his painting of a pipe are the words “Ceci n’est pas une pipe,” which is French for “this is not a pipe.” As he’s trying to show, it’s a representation of a pipe.</p> <p>Magritte shows that painters will run into the map/territory distinction whenever they try to draw what they see. Even if they can create beautiful representations of reality, they can never recreate precisely what they saw with their eyes.</p> <p>​ In 2015, I was moved to tears at a Porter Robinson concert. To date, his Worlds live set is the best piece of art I’ve ever seen. Standing in the audience, a football field away from his all-glass DJ stand, I felt like he was speaking to me personally as he told the story of his entire childhood in just 90 minutes. In a desperate attempt to capture the moment, I recorded videos of the lionhearted bass drops and the sea of voices in the crowd. But even with a high-end smartphone camera, I was able to preserve only a slice of that divine moment. Whenever I show the recordings to friends, it looks to them like every other EDM concert they’ve seen: “Looks cool, bro.”</p> <p>​ And I’m stuck thinking, “You just had to be there.”</p> <p>​ Late in the evening, whenever I’m nostalgic for that live show and long for something comforting, I’ll open my phone and re-watch the highlights. But no matter how many times I pray for a different outcome, that intense feeling is forever gone. Never again will the bass assault my senses like it did on that warm Baltimore night.</p> <p>​ As a fan of electronic music, the delta between the territory of lived experience and the map of recorded videos makes me want to throw my phone off a 17-story building. To my despair, videos will never recreate the embodied experience of majesty I felt during Porter’s live set. But as a consumer, I appreciate when creators run their ideas through an unforgiving filter of compression until only the finest minerals are left. The more information is compressed, the more efficiently it can travel from creator to consumer. Even if it’s an incomplete representation of reality, few things are more satisfying than concentrated gems of information that express a lot about the world.</p> <p>​</p> <h3 id="but-distorted-maps-can-be-useful">BUT DISTORTED MAPS CAN BE USEFUL</h3> <p>​ ​Maps can be useful, even if they’re inaccurate. In fact, we use distorted maps all the time. For years, I didn’t realize that Brooklyn was so much bigger than Manhattan because of the design of the subway map, which makes Manhattan look way bigger than it actually is. But there’s a good reason for the distortion. If the subway map was drawn to scale, riders wouldn’t be able to navigate through Manhattan, where the density of tracks is highest. New Yorkers can efficiently use the subway because the map lies about the city’s geography.</p> <p>The New York City subway map distorts—and compresses—the landscape in additional ways. For example, it only shows the main streets above ground, and it makes them look straighter than they actually are. Central Park looks like a square, even though it’s much more of a rectangle. Instead of showing every transit hub, it shows only the airports, and even when it does, the map removes the runways and makes the terminals seem bigger than they actually are. The end result is a well-compressed map that shows only what riders need to see.</p> <p>​ Like a maple syrup manufacturer, New York’s map designers removed irrelevant details of the map until they were left with nothing but a collection of sugary sweetness. At the cost of accuracy, most of the city’s details have been removed so passengers can focus on getting to their destination.</p> <p>​ In that way, the map is like a diamond — a form of ultra-concentrated carbon compressed in the earth’s molten core, 100 miles below your feet, at temperatures of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, where pressure exceeds 725,000 pounds per square inch. Just like diamonds and just like maple syrup, only by exposing our ideas to the force of compression can we trim the excess until we’re left with nothing but the sweet taste of compression.</p> <h2 id="day-40">Day #40</h2> <h3 id="write-clear-sentences">Write CLEAR Sentences</h3> <p>​</p> <p>In my last round of edits, right before I publish an article, I have one focus: writing CLEAR sentences.</p> <p>​ The acronym CLEAR stands for:</p> <ul> <li>Create a rhythm</li> <li>Link your sentences</li> <li>Eliminate anything that adds confusion</li> <li>Add colorful details</li> <li>Remove unnecessary details ​ I’ll describe each in turn.</li> </ul> <p>​ Create a Rhythm: Great writing has rhythm. It’s like a dance, and words are the music that create the atmosphere. The easiest way to add rhythm to your writing is to vary sentence length. Short sentences speed things up, and long sentences slooooooowwwwww things down.</p> <p>Link Your Sentences: Every sentence should follow from the one before it, lead into the one after it, and connect with the paragraph’s topic sentence. ​</p> <p>Eliminate Anything That Adds Confusion: Read your writing out-loud, and mark the places where you stumble. It’ll usually happen because of an unnecessarily big word or a sentence with irregular syntax. Wait to make edits as you read. Read a few paragraphs at a time and bold the parts that cause you to stumble. That way, you can get into the same flow your reader will experience when they enjoy your work. Then, edit your writing in sections.</p> <p>​ Add Colorful Details: Sol Stein once wrote: “Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader, not the fact that it’s raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.” That feeling is revealed through detail. Make your reader feel the puddle of water in your shoes, the frustration of having your umbrella flip upside down during a thunderstorm, or the way wet clothes hug your body so tightly that you waddle like a penguin.</p> <p>​ Remove Unnecessary Details: Good writing packs a tremendous amount of information in a small number of words. Tactically, start by removing intensifying words like “very” or “extremely.” As crutches of the English language, they reveal weaknesses in your prose. Then remove words that don’t move your argument forward. Sometimes, I pretend I’m hiring a translator. Most of them charge 10 cents per word, so you can save money by deleting superfluous words. But the trick also inspires clarity. As Derek Sivers wrote: “If you can communicate the same idea with fewer words, it’s more likely to be read and understood. A sentence that’s easier to translate is also easier to understand.”</p> <p>​ The implicit message of my CLEAR Sentences framework is that you’ll delete most of what you write. Emotionally, it’s painful but your readers will thank you for it. You know you’ve made the necessary edits when your reader thinks they could’ve written what you published so aim to make writing look so easy that you inspire them to copy you. Only then will they feel the weight of your accomplishment.</p> <h2 id="day-41">Day #41</h2> <h3 id="cribs-my-writing-feedback-formula">CRIBS: My Writing Feedback Formula</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Using my CRIBS system, the average person can give excellent writing feedback. The acronym stands for: confusing, repeated, interesting, boring, surprising. ​</p> <p>Feedback is useful because we are blind to our own ideas. We struggle to separate good ones from bad ones or determine when they’re unclear. But when we ask friends for feedback, they’re not helpful. If they’re trying to be nice, they’ll shower you with compliments and superficial critiques which means your writing won’t improve. Sometimes, they’ll bash your writing which makes you feel worthless and dejected.</p> <p>​ CRIBS turns anybody into an editor because it focuses on the emotions of your reader instead of the mechanics of writing. Together, the observations follow the MECE principle from consulting: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Every emotion comes with an obvious next step, which I’ll explain below.</p> <p>​ Confusing: Communication is the essence of writing. Effective writing happens when ideas are efficiently transferred from the writer’s brain to the reader’s. But confusing writing, which happens when the author tries to sound smart or doesn’t think clearly about what they’re trying to say, slows the transmission of knowledge.</p> <p>​ Next step: If your writing is confusing because you’re trying to sound smart, replace your SAT words with ones that everybody understands. Alternatively, it may be proof that you haven’t thought enough about what you’re trying to write. If so, clarify your ideas by simplifying them.</p> <p>​ Repeated: Good writing is concise. By definition, if you’re repeating yourself, your writing isn’t as concise as it could be. Repeating the same ideas is the writing equivalent of your mom telling you something you already know, over and over again. It’s a self-insult too because when you repeat yourself, you’re effectively saying: “I expressed myself so poorly the first time that I have to say the same thing again.”</p> <p>​ Next step: Delete the repetitive parts.</p> <p>​ Interesting: “Interesting” is the holy grail of online writing. It happens when insight meets entertainment, when you comfort the confused or confuse the comforted. By asking your editor to identify the most interesting sections, you’ll receive compliments that sustain your momentum and know where to double down.</p> <p>​ Next step: Add prominence to your interesting ideas by writing more about them.</p> <p>​ Boring: Readers have a zero-tolerance policy for boredom. They’ll click away once your writing becomes boring, but if you can keep them engaged, they’ll give you hours of their attention. Ask your editor to tell you which sections they wanted to skip or caused their mind to wander.</p> <p>​ Next step: When something is boring, delete or rewrite it. The answer depends on if your writing is boring because of the ideas themselves or how you’re communicating them. If the idea is the problem, cut it. Or, if your delivery is the problem, rewrite the boring sections.</p> <p>​ Surprising: Your job as a writer is to surprise your reader by telling them things they didn’t know and didn’t expect. Ideas that are new but not surprising are trivial. In contrast, surprising ideas break the reader’s mental model for how the world works, either by comforting the confused or confusing the comforted.</p> <p>​ Next step: Delete everything that’s not surprising. Then pretend you’re a horror movie director by building suspense before every surprise.</p> <p>​ CRIBS works as well with speaking as it does with writing because all the included emotions are easy to identify in people’s facial expressions: people raise their eyebrows when they’re confused, ask you to speed up when you repeat yourself, lean in when they’re interested, turn away when they’re bored, and gasp when they’re surprised. By paying attention to how people respond to your ideas in casual conversation, you can develop your ideas before you sit down to type them.</p> <h2 id="day-42">Day #42</h2> <h3 id="the-public-to-private-bridge">The Public to Private Bridge</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Just because you have attention, doesn’t mean you have an audience. ​</p> <p>An audience isn’t the number of people who know your name. It’s the number of people you can contact at any time. Building one begins with attracting people on public platforms such as Twitter and YouTube. They act like public squares, where people can find you serendipitously. But what they give you in free reach, they take away in the lack of a connection to your audience. The public platforms own your data and they reserve the right to kick you off the platform at their discretion. It’s like building a castle out of sand.</p> <p>​ Don’t let a public platform control your entire audience. A video streaming platform called Meerkat learned this lesson the hard way. In its early days, it integrated with Twitter so all a user’s followers received a notification whenever they went live. But one day, after Twitter launched a competing app called Periscope, they revoked access to their graph and effectively put the company out of business.</p> <p>​ If public platforms are so risky, why do you use them?</p> <p>​ Public platforms give you reach. Sharing ideas there is the fastest way to grow your audience, so long as they eventually sign up for your private channels. Instagram grew quickly by helping users post photos on Facebook and Twitter, which eventually drew them to its own app which people now visit directly. Likewise, Youtube grew on the back of MySpace by making it easy for people to embed videos on the platform, and over time, people visited YouTube directly. In the writing sphere, James Clear grew his audience on the back of Google search’s public platform but converted 900,000 of those readers into email subscribers who he can now contact directly. Fueled by those direct relationships, his book Atomic Habits climbed to the #1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List.</p> <h2 id="day-43">Day #43</h2> <h3 id="the-soulja-boy-strategy">The Soulja Boy Strategy</h3> <p>​</p> <p>When I was a kid, I discovered a rapper named Soulja Boy who curated music playlists and posted them on a website called SoundClick, where he had one of the top-10 biggest audiences.</p> <p>​ He was new to making music, so people only followed him for his taste. As his audience grew, he diversified onto YouTube and MySpace. One day, he slipped his song into one of his playlists. People liked it so much that the song rose to the top of the music charts. Coupled with an iconic dance, “Crank That” spent seven weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. In retrospect, the song was successful not just because of quality but because of his curation-driven distribution advantage.</p> <p>​ Like Soulja Boy, if you want to start creating but don’t know where to begin, start with curation. It’s a gateway drug to publishing your own ideas because it gives you the license to experiment without the pressure of coming up with new ideas yourself. Besides, you’re already doing most of the work because sourcing and consuming ideas is 80% of the curation process. Write a description about each recommendation, as if you were talking to a friend. Then, publish it.</p> <p>​ To be sure, curation isn’t aggregation. You can find a list of links anywhere. It’s the commentary that differentiates you. Add your own interpretive layer to the links you gather so you can save your reader time. Include enough context to inform your reader, but not so much that consuming it becomes a slog.</p> <p>​ Like a high-end restaurant, the fewer options on the menu, the better. In my weekly Friday Finds newsletter, I add a short description to links I share every week (never more than five). I aim to make the premise original enough that it makes the reader say: “Hmm, I’ve never thought of that before.” While I have my audience’s attention, I pull a Soulja Boy and include my own links too.</p> <h2 id="day-44">Day #44</h2> <h3 id="dont-find-a-niche-create-one">Don’t Find a Niche. Create One.</h3> <p>​​ I deplore the phrase: “Find Your Niche.”</p> <p>​ It’s always felt too passive. It assumes that a niche is like an Easter Egg that you’ll find if you look hard enough. But the most interesting ideas don’t yet have names. Creatives who explore them traverse the waters of uncertainty and expand the horizon of human knowledge, either by capitalizing on how the world is changing or occupying an unexplored intersection of ideas.</p> <p>​ The difference between finding a niche and creating one mirrors the difference between existing demand and created demand. We usually think about existing demand when we think of economics. It describes known products that people know they want and already have a budget for. No matter how much of the product is created, people won’t change their consumption patterns much. In contrast, created demand shows how an increase in supply can generate an increase in demand. Highways are the classic example of how unintuitive it is. Throughout the 20th century, urban planners were consistently surprised by how adding lanes to highways increased the number of cars on the road. Demand for transportation isn’t as static as they thought. The wider the highways, the more people use them.</p> <p>​ When you build a Personal Monopoly, you are creating demand for an idea people didn’t know they were interested in. The most successful creators tend to define their own subculture instead of molding themselves into existing ones. In online writing, Ben Thompson started studying the business of technology while the rest of the tech media focused on gadgets and hot releases. In academia, Rene Girard was the first person to see how the same pattern of conflict showed up in literature, anthropology, mythology, and religion; and in music, nobody played RockJazz until Eric Lewis. Rather than playing the piano conventionally, he reached inside the piano and pulled the strings directly instead of touching the keys. Through the force of that niche, he combined the energy of rock with the improvisational aspect of jazz.</p> <p>​ On the Internet, differentiation is free marketing so the more you can avoid competition, the better. Once you settle on newfound intellectual real estate, it’s time to build: create new terms, write about earned secrets, follow the Small Fish, Growing Pond Strategy, and relentlessly improve your craft. Only then will you build your personal monopoly.</p> <h2 id="day-45">Day #45</h2> <h3 id="get-wonky">Get Wonky</h3> <p>​</p> <p>Patrick O’Shaughnessy runs one of the largest investing podcasts in the world. ​</p> <p>When I ask my friends why they religiously listen to every episode, they say: “There’s nothing else like it on the Internet.” His podcast, Invest Like the Best explores the business world with a level of wonkiness that MBA programs don’t even sniff. Unlike the wonk-free, lowest-common-denominator publications we grew up on, he assumes his listeners are resourceful and hyper-intelligent. As a result, he’s attracted a legion of impressive listeners who’ve become his guests such as Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Shopify founder Toby Lutke, and Stripe co-founder John Collison. ​</p> <p>As the show has grown, the episodes have become wonkier. They now go so far into the details that a causal observer would say: “Nobody’s interested in that.” And yet, the wonkiest episodes tend to be the most popular ones. As Patrick says: “On the internet, the more focused you are, the more wonky and niche you are, the bigger your audience is. I think the internet rewards the edges of distributions, and I just happened to be really interested in one of those edges, which was deep, wonky business and investing discussions.” ​</p> <p>Wonky people have an enthusiastic interest in the specialized details of their domain. They ignore the social incentives that shame people for having unique interests. Wonkiness is the opposite of how you’re trained in school, where you’re taught to follow the syllabus and repeat exactly what the teacher said in the exact way they said it. ​</p> <p>Wonkiness is an algorithm for fresh ideas. It’s how you liberate yourself from the handcuffs of precedent and in our oversocialized world, it’s increasingly rare. The trick is to nurture it until you have passion without ideology and obsessiveness without dogmatism. Wonkiness is how Prince played with gender, adopted a flamboyant style, and blended rock, soul, R&amp;B, and synth-pop to shatter the unwritten rules of music. It’s why Casey Neistat turned the camera around and started filming himself instead of the world beyond him, even after HBO cancelled his show and people mocked him. ​</p> <p>But once you get wonky, you’ll have a combination of ideas nobody’s ever seen before.</p> <h2 id="day-46">Day #46</h2> <h3 id="find-your-scenius">Find Your Scenius</h3> <p>​</p> <p>In the ancient world, the word “genius” referred to communities as often as people. ​</p> <p>The musician-philosopher Brian Eno has a different name for the same idea: Scenius. It describes the intelligence and intuition of a cultural scene, as if genius is a communal pursuit as much as an individual one. In Eno’s words: “If genius is the creative intelligence of an individual, Scenius is the creative intelligence of a group.” ​</p> <p>Scenius is The Eagle and Child pub in Oxford, where C.S Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien frequented and birthed three of the five best-selling fantasy novels of all time: The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings; it’s The Bloomsbury Group, a loose collective of friends who met in England in the early 20th century such as Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, and John Maynard Keynes; it’s the Scottish Enlightenment which took place in late-18th century Edinburgh and inspired intellectuals like Adam Smith and David Hume; it’s early 20th century Vienna which birthed the artist Gustav Klimt, physicist Ernst Mach, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, psychologists Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and economists Ludwig von Mises and Fredrich Hayek; and it’s the early days of YCombinator which created companies like Reddit, Dropbox, DoorDash, Airbnb, and Stripe. ​</p> <p>As Stripe founder Patrick Collison said: “Looking backwards, it’s striking how unevenly distributed progress has been in the past…the discoveries that came to elevate standards of living for everyone arose in comparatively tiny geographic pockets of innovative effort.” ​</p> <p>What did these groups have in common? ​</p> <p>Often, leaps in progress are catalyzed by a step-change in how people think about the world. Leon Battista Alberti created the conditions for the Renaissance when he laid out the principles of linear perspective and elevated the cultural status of painters in a text called Della Pittura. Progress exploded when, between the years 1310 and 1510, artists learned how to paint with depth and perspective.</p> <p>(Some Images)</p> <p>For the first time in human history, scenius is moving beyond physical geography. It’s happening on the Internet now. And it’s alive in obscure Discord forums, private group chats, and online schools. ​</p> <p>​Write of Passage, for example, is a community of hundreds of ambitious writers who love ideas and bond over the beautiful struggle of creation. Friendships are formed as the loneliness of writing disappears and writing becomes a communal endeavor. In the future, we’ll look back with surprise at how many of the world’s top Internet writers were a part of it. ​</p> <p>Like Write of Passage, sceniuses balance the free flow of ideas with strict cultural norms. Members are competitive enough to motivate each other but cooperative enough to find joy in their success. They meet often enough to share ideas but work independently enough to develop their own voice. Though they are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, they root themselves in a core set of principles. Too open, and their strong culture disappears. Too closed, and they lack the dynamism that generates progress. With the right social dynamics in place, the group becomes a scenius.</p> <h2 id="day-47">Day #47</h2> <h3 id="one-big-idea">One Big Idea</h3> <p>​</p> <p>We live in the age of Performative Reading.</p> <p>​ Consuming as many books as possible has become a competitive sport for knowledge workers who want to show off their intellectual curiosity. To do so, they race through books like they’re collecting mushrooms in Super Mario Kart.</p> <p>​ This modern reading habit stems from a deep-rooted cultural insecurity. We no longer believe that one idea can be transformative.</p> <p>​ Instead, we follow a binge-watching, TED-Talks-before-bed strategy where we hop from epiphany to epiphany without investigating any of the ideas. Our obsession with learning has descended into an obsession with consumption, as if the answers we need to take action are lurking in the next book, the next documentary, or the next Netflix show. But consuming more information does not necessarily make you more competent.</p> <p>​ In contrast to the sprint to read every book on Kindle, Charlie Munger once said: “Take a simple idea and take it seriously.” Many of the most successful people I’ve studied have found their edge by putting their faith in one big idea. They’ve committed to the idea, and studied it so much that its implications have become second nature.</p> <p>​ Two people, Rich Barton and Richard Mosse, stand out.</p> <p>​</p> <h3 id="rich-bartons-big-idea-power-to-the-people">RICH BARTON’S BIG IDEA: POWER TO THE PEOPLE</h3> <p>​ Rich Barton has built his career by “bringing power to the people.” Consumer technology markets are notoriously difficult. Repeatable success is almost impossible, so the founders of most successful consumer companies almost never start a second major company. But Barton has founded three billion-dollar companies: Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor.</p> <p>​ On the surface, these three companies look different. But under the hood, they are mirror images of each other. All of them attacked a big opaque market, such as travel, real estate, and corporate recruiting. They used the Internet to remove the information asymmetry between establishment gatekeepers and ordinary consumers. As Kevin Kwok wrote in Making Uncommon Knowledge Common:</p> <p>​ “Barton career can be summed up by his mantra “Power to the People”. His companies take power from the incumbents and give it to consumers.</p> <p>​ Instead of trying to hoard information, they are on the side of consumers and giving them more data transparency. Glassdoor revealed how employees really felt about companies. Zillow shed light on what any house was worth. Expedia let people see the prices and availability of flights and hotels without talking to an agent.</p> <p>​ Expedia wants to be the first place you go when you travel. Glassdoor wants to be the destination when you’re thinking about companies to work for. And Zillow wants to be the place you go to look at real estate.”</p> <p>​ To attack the travel market, Expedia publicized the prices for flights and hotels that were once only available to travel agents; to attack the real estate market, Zillow used the Zestimate to give people a ballpark number for what their house was really worth; and to attack the corporate recruiting market, Glassdoor gave people honest reviews about the experience of working at a company that were more honest than what recruiters or companies provided.</p> <p>​ Data network effects kicked in once these companies gathered a critical mass of information. With it, they used Google search and word-of-mouth as their top acquisition channels, both of which are low-cost. All three companies became encyclopedias of critical information on flights, hotels, houses, and corporations. Crucially, all of them capitalized on the parallel wave of smartphones and consumer familiarity with digital platforms. These companies could not have been built before the Internet. By riding the Internet wave, Barton built three companies that look different but all employ the same One Big Idea.</p> <h3 id="richard-mosses-big-idea-photograph-the-invisible">RICHARD MOSSE’S BIG IDEA: PHOTOGRAPH THE INVISIBLE</h3> <p>​ In January 2018, I visited the National Gallery of Art in Melbourne, Australia. There, I was mesmerized by Richard Mosse’s Incoming exhibit, where he captured the experience of refugees from North Africa and the Middle East using military-grade thermal detection cameras. Usually, the technology is used for military surveillance, often to identify and track targets. Instead of capturing visible light, it detects body heat, which the human eye cannot see.</p> <p>​ Mosse represented his subjects in unfamiliar ways by turning them into inverted silhouettes without identity. Each person glows with body heat. Instead of being divided by race, viewers are united by the shared temperature of humanity.</p> <p>​ All of Mosse’s work follows the one big idea of using cameras to highlight aspects of the world that are beyond the grasp of the naked eye. His central idea is simple: use photographs to illuminate the invisible.</p> <h3 id="the-reality-you-cannot-see">THE REALITY YOU CANNOT SEE</h3> <p>​ The world is more complex than we see. When you look at the world through the lens of your One Big Idea, you see opportunities others are blind to. In that way, the One Big Idea is just like the Electromagnetic Light Spectrum. There are light waves flying all around us — radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-Ray, and Gamma Ray. But humans can only see visible light, even though we know the other ones exist. Consistent with the themes in the aforementioned Richard Mosse paintings, the light waves we see determine our view onto the world.</p> <p>I held a mirror into my own reality blindness during a recent trip to my friend Nick’s apartment. When I walked into his living room, he winked, smiled, and said he had something to show me. I knew I was in for a treat. Nick grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania. His father was an engineer who taught him how to work with his hands and be handy around the house, a skill I don’t have. Together, we climbed a shaky ladder to an attic he’d converted to a small bedroom, where the bed suspended in mid-air using four ropes that connected to 100-year-old Carnegie Steel beams. From the mattress, I looked through the glass windows above and saw the Freedom Tower, an army of airplanes, and a chorus of stars twinkling over the New York sky.</p> <p>​ Nick had converted dead space in his apartment into one of the coolest rooms I’d seen in New York. I would have never thought of his clever creation, no matter how long I lived in the apartment. But because of his skills, turning the attic into a loft was an obvious decision.</p> <p>​ Study a panoramic idea for long enough and you’ll start to see its effects everywhere. People with intimate knowledge of One Big Idea monopolize a narrow band of the light spectrum, which gives them access to ideas and opportunities regular people miss. Like Nick, you’ll have the kind of realizations that seem amazing to others, but obvious to you.</p> <p>​ MY ONE BIG IDEA ​ Everybody has a worldview, a unique way of looking at the world. There is no such thing as pure objectivity. The world is pregnant with opportunities, which reveal themselves to us once we decide how we want to see. Building a worldview seems constraining at first. Why would you limit yourself to a small set of ideas? In reality, doubling down on One Big Idea is like walking through a portal into a vast, panoramic space you couldn’t have imagined. It’s the same story we see in movies, from Platform 9 3/4 in Harry Potter, to the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, to the wardrobe at Professor Kirke’s House in The Chronicles of Narnia which is a door into the limitless world of Narnia.</p> <p>​ David Foster Wallace spoke about worship in his famous 2005 speech called This is Water, and the idea applies equally to building a worldview:</p> <p>​ “In the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.”</p> <p>​ If we are destined to follow the compass of our worldview, we should design it deliberately. Like Rich Barton and Richard Mosse, both of whom got rich pursuing One Big Idea, we should look for a panoramic framework to interpret the world through.</p> <p>​ As for me, I’m still developing my One Big Idea. For now, I’ve sunk my teeth into the belief that people systematically under-estimate the scale and interconnectedness of the Internet. I first discovered the idea in college, when I received my first job from Twitter and skipped college classes because learning on the Internet was faster and more enjoyable. Those experiences led me to start Write of Passage, an online writing school where students learn how to build their audience, make friends on the Internet, and improve the quality of their writing. All my thinking orbits the central idea of the internet’s impact on learning, entrepreneurship, and personal relationships.</p> <p>​ In my pursuit, I’m guided by the famous words of Bruce Lee: “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”</p> <h2 id="day-48">Day #48</h2> <h3 id="audience-first-products">Audience-First Products</h3> <p>​</p> <p>I was a senior in college, and it was time to look for a job. So, I went to my school’s job fair.</p> <p>​ From the second I arrived, I knew the job fair was a dead end. Hundreds of job-hunting students walked around with the same blue suits, the same black portfolios, the same red pens, and the same lost expressions. The recruiters were advertising the kinds of jobs that knock the soul out of people—the kinds of jobs that inhale our young, talented people and turn them into cogs.</p> <p>​ The numbers tell this story. According to a 2013 Harvard Business Review survey of 12,000 professionals, half of the respondents said their job had no meaning and significance.</p> <p>​ A job at most of these corporations was a short-term win, but a long-term loss.</p> <p>​ I wanted something different for myself.</p> <p>​ MY FIRST JOB ​ The Internet swallows up an increasing percentage of our leisure time, but people under-estimate the economic opportunities it presents — even for college seniors. For instance, the Internet is a better job matching tool than a job fair will ever be. Even in college, when I had less than 1,000 followers on Twitter, I could reach the kinds of decision-makers online I would have never met at a job fair.</p> <p>​ After I left the job fair, I committed to finding a job by using Twitter. The next week, I woke up late on a Tuesday morning and the rain was coming down sideways. I didn’t feel like going outside, so I skipped class to write a series of tweets about the future of online publishing. With them, I attracted the attention of Jason Stein, the CEO of Laundry Service, a New York-based advertising agency I wanted to work for. Impressed by my ideas, he replied with eight words that changed my life: “Interested in working with us when you graduate?”</p> <p>Ever since Jason’s unexpected message, I’ve used the Internet to create every meaningful professional opportunity I’ve had, including my first business. ​</p> <p>First, I discovered the Internet was a better way to find a job. Then, I used the Internet to build my business. What follows is the three-step process I’ve used to create professional opportunities online.</p> <p>​ THE RISE OF AUDIENCE-FIRST PRODUCTS ​ My method of “Audience-First Products” is still experimental, but I believe it’s repeatable. It’s a new way to test the feasibility of a business idea. It stands in stark contrast to the “old guard” model of attending job fairs, working mindless jobs to learn professional skills, and raising money before you start a business.</p> <p>​ Here’s the three-step process I used to capitalize on the transition to the online economy:</p> <ol> <li>Build an audience</li> <li>Build a product</li> <li>Scale the solution</li> </ol> <p>​ Here’s how it works.</p> <p>​ Step 1: Build an Audience: Before the Internet, companies built products first, audiences later. Now, they build audiences before products. People are taught to hunt down interesting people, ideas, and opportunities. But masters of the Internet attract them.</p> <p>​ Sharing ideas attracts like-minded people who double as a feedback loop to make you smarter and more interesting. Through direct feedback, having an audience will give you a unique perspective on the world. You’ll receive instant, high-quality feedback on the ideas you share.</p> <p>​ Ignore them, and make the Internet small instead. Define your interests. Then write about them. When you find a group that resonates with your writing and you want to connect with them, write for their interests. As you do, you’ll make it easy for others obsessed with that interest to find you. When you write in-depth about an off-the-beaten-path subject, you’ll attract people at the outer edges of the personality curve. Use it to shrink the world, and surround yourself with like-minded people.</p> <p>​ Define your own intersection of ideas by writing about topics nobody else is writing about and putting a name to your perspective. When you write about a specific topic, you’ll find you and your audience share common challenges that double as areas of entrepreneurial opportunity and topics to write about. As you write this way, you will define your unique lens on the world, share it passionately, and attract both casual friends and professional collaborators.</p> <p>​ As you build your Audience-First Product, focus on resonance instead of scale. Most online metrics focus on how many people you reach, not the depth of relationships you build with them.</p> <h2 id="day-49">Day #49</h2> <h3 id="build-a-personal-monopoly">Build a Personal Monopoly</h3> <p>​ Jerry Garcia once said: “You want to be the only person who does what you do.” ​</p> <p>The ultimate goal of writing online is to build a Personal Monopoly. It’s your unique intersection of skills, interests, and personality traits where you can be known as the best thinker on a topic and open yourself up to the serendipity that makes writing online so special. ​</p> <p>The Internet uniquely rewards people with Personal Monopolies because it rewards differentiation. But just as global markets increase the upside of having a Personal Monopoly because every creator can broadcast their ideas to a global audience, they make it hard to create one because of all the competition. ​</p> <p>Your Personal Monopoly should reflect your innate interests, not what you think the world wants. There are two reasons why: (1) the Internet creates power law outcomes so if you’re not fascinated by what you’re writing about, you won’t be world-class at it, and (2) due to the immense scale of the Internet, the audience for almost every topic numbers in the thousands. If you’re chasing a trend, you’ve already lost. ​</p> <p>​Listen to the world as you publish. Decorrelate yourself from others, so you can build the kind of skillset that makes people say: “I’ve never met somebody like you before.” Your skills should be unusual, complementary, experiential, and specific. The less the skills in your Personal Monopoly Venn-diagram are found together, the better because it reduces competition and helps you define a genre. ​</p> <p>Some Personal Monopolies are more valuable than others, so think like an investor. Pick a small, but ever-growing market and learn everything you can about it. Build expertise before the other settlers arrive. All you need is a tiny, but lucrative sliver of intellectual real estate. No matter where you settle, subtle tweaks in your positioning can create vast differences in your financial outcomes. Say you want to build a Personal Monopoly around teaching math through humor: You’ll make $50,000 as a 3rd-grade math teacher but potentially millions of dollars as an online math teacher with an influential email list. ​</p> <p>If your Personal Monopoly isn’t immediately obvious, that’s okay. Most people take five years to find theirs. As you search, double down on the ideas that captivate you, the compliments people give you, and the projects you enjoy working on. Then, share the best of what you learn online. Write about every aspect of your Personal Monopoly: the people, the concepts, the history. All of it. Then, persuade your readers to cross your Public to Private Bridge.​ ​</p> <p>When you build your Personal Monopoly, you say yes to playing a worldwide game that most people don’t even know exists. ​</p> <p>Forge a distinct path instead of copying what everybody else is doing. Work on ambitious projects, study the unexplored intersections of ideas and find the questions that people are asking but nobody is answering. There is a vast intellectual frontier waiting for you to find it. As you settle upon these lands, you’ll build your Personal Monopoly.</p> <h2 id="day-50">Day #50</h2> <h3 id="be-a-personal-monopoly-investor">Be a Personal Monopoly Investor</h3> <p>​</p> <p>​Building a Personal Monopoly is like buying real estate.</p> <p>​ Whether you’re making an investment in yourself or a home, you want to choose a strategy that will increase in value. When it comes to housing prices, some areas have appreciated in value more than others. For example, real estate values in cities like San Francisco have appreciated more than rural ones like Billings, Montana. There are two main reasons for the San Francisco boom: increasing demand and restricted supply.</p> <p>​ Basic economy theory says that all things being equal, increasing demand will cause prices to rise. In 2017, the top 25 metro areas made up more than half of American GDP which is why so many young people moved to big cities. San Francisco in particular became a hub for people working in technology. But its real estate values wouldn’t have risen so much without restricted supply. Apartment buildings are illegal to build in 78.6% of San Francisco. Laws and culture make it hard to build in San Francisco, which is why only 5,000 homes were constructed there in 2015 and not a single home was built in some of San Francisco’s wealthiest neighborhoods. In contrast, Tokyo had 142,417 housing starts a year earlier.</p> <p>The politics of San Francisco housing policy are beyond the scope of this essay, but I’ve written about them before.</p> <p>​ For now, let’s focus on building Personal Monopolies.​</p> <p>​ On the increasing demand side, you should look for growing markets. When I graduated from college, I watched my friends who were interested in finance split into two camps: some followed the traditional route and others studied cryptocurrencies. The ones who followed the established paths are still toiling for 80 hours per week in jobs they mostly despise. But one clever friend (we’ll call him Victor) focused on cryptocurrencies instead. The industry gave him a comparative advantage because it rewarded youth, unlike the other paths he could have taken. As they say in software, he turned a bug into a feature. He devoted his entire senior year of college to developing technical expertise, studying markets, and writing about what he learned. Today, at 26-years-old, he manages hundreds of millions of dollars for a hedge fund in New York. On the scarcity restriction side, Victor now has four years of industry experience, easy-to-demonstrate technical expertise, and a strong industry network that helped him raise all that capital.</p> <p>​ Like real estate, invest in Personal Monopolies with increasing demand and restricted supply. On the increasing demand side, don’t chase hype. If you’re starting from scratch, the hype wave will pass faster than you can become an expert in a subject. Instead, find the intersection between your genuine curiosities and how you think the future will be different. For me, that’s online writing but you can pick anything in the Go-For-It Window. On the supply restriction side, leverage your most unique experiences and build knowledge that’s simultaneously hard to replicate and easy to demonstrate. That way, you can be paid for your expertise. When it comes to your personality type, favor your most distinct traits. Do things that feel like play to you, but look like work to others. By doing so, you’ll invest in a valuable Personal Monopoly.</p> <aside class="share"> <p>Liked this note?
